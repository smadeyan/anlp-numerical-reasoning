    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "$$\\frac{18^2-16^2}{2}=\\frac{(18-16)(18+16)}{2}=\\frac{(2)(34)}{2}=\\boxed{34}$$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"The area of square A is 25. The area of square B is 81. What's the length difference between the sides of square A and B?\", \"answer\": \"The area of a square is calculated as length * width. Because all a square has all sides equal then we can say that given a side S, the area is S*S\\nFor square A of sides A, the area is A*A=25 or A^2=25\\nSolving for A we know that A=<<5=5>>5\\nFor square B of sides B, the area is B*B=81 or B^2=81\\nSolving for B we know that B=<<9=9>>9\\nThe side difference between A and B is 9-5=<<9-5=4>>4\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"What is fifteen more than a quarter of 48?\", \"answer\": \"A quarter of 48 is 48/4=<<48/4=12>>12.\\nThe number is 12+15=<<12+15=27>>27.\\n#### 27\"}\n{\"question\": \"Fifteen more than a quarter of a number is 27.
