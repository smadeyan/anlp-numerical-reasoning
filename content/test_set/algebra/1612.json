    "problem": "I had been planning to work for 20 hours a week for 12 weeks this summer to earn $\\$3000$ to buy a used car. Unfortunately, I got sick for the first two weeks of the summer and didn't work any hours. How many hours a week will I have to work for the rest of the summer if I still want to buy the car?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "If the total amount that I earn for the summer is constant, then the number of hours I work each week and the total number of weeks that I work are inversely proportional. Consequently, if I only work $\\frac{10}{12}=\\frac56$ as many weeks, I need to work $\\frac{6}{5}$ as many hours each week. $\\frac{6}{5}\\cdot20=24$, so I need to work $\\boxed{24}$ hours a week.",

How much does he make a week?\", \"answer\": \"He rents it out for 8*4=<<8*4=32>>32 hours\\nThat means he makes 32*20=$<<32*20=640>>640\\n#### 640\"}\n{\"question\": \"From March to August, Sam made $460 doing 23 hours of yard work.
