    "problem": "The positive difference between the two roots of the quadratic equation $3x^2 - 7x - 8 = 0$ can be written as $\\frac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $n$ is an integer and $m$ is an integer not divisible by the square of any prime number. Find $m + n$.",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The roots of the equation are given by $\\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{7^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 8}}{2 \\cdot 3}$. When taking their difference, the term $7$ in the numerator cancels out, so the difference is $2 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{7^2 + 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 8}}{2 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{\\sqrt{145}}{3}$. Thus, the answer is $145 + 3 = \\boxed{148}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"The base of a hill located beside a river is 300m above the seabed. If this depth is a quarter of the vertical distance between the riverbed and the peak of the hill, how high is the hill?\", \"answer\": \"300m is a quarter of the distance from the riverbed to the hill's peak so (1/4)*distance from riverbed to peak = 300m\\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 4 gives the distance from riverbed to peak = 300m*4 = <<300*4=1200>>1200m\\nThe height of the hill is the difference between the distance from the riverbed to the hill's peak and the distance from the riverbed to the hill's base which is 1200m-300m = <<1200-300=900>>900m\\n#### 900\"}\n{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates. If there are 45 pirates, how many noodles and pirates are there in total?\", \"answer\": \"In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45-7=<<45-7=38>>38 noodles.\\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 38+45=<<38+45=83>>83\\n#### 83\"}"
