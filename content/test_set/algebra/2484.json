    "problem": "Angela has deposited $\\$8,\\!000$ into an account that pays $6\\%$ interest compounded annually.\n\nBob has deposited $\\$10,\\!000$ into an account that pays $7\\%$ simple annual interest.\n\nIn $20$ years Angela and Bob compare their respective balances. To the nearest dollar, what is the positive difference between their balances?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We may find Angela's balance by simply finding $\\$8,\\!000(1 + 0.06)^{20} \\approx \\$25,\\!657.08.$\n\nWe may find Bob's balance by finding $\\$10,\\!000(1 + 20 \\cdot 0.07) \\approx \\$24,\\!000.$\n\nTherefore, the difference between their balances is roughly $\\$25,\\!657.08 - \\$24,\\!000 \\approx \\boxed{\\$1,\\!657}.$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Mark deposited $88 in a bank. Bryan deposited $40 less than five times as much as Mark. How much did Mark deposit in the bank?\", \"answer\": \"Five times the amount Mark deposited is $88 x 5 = $<<88*5=440>>440.\\nSo, Mark deposited $440 - $40 = $<<440-40=400>>400.\\n#### 400\"}\n{\"question\": \"Gina has two bank accounts. Each account has a quarter of the balance in Betty's account. If Betty's account balance is $3,456, what is the combined balance of both Gina's accounts?\", \"answer\": \"Each of Gina's account has $3456 / 4 accounts = $<<3456/4=864>>864/account\\nHer combined account balance is therefore $864 + $864 = $<<864+864=1728>>1728\\n#### 1728\"}\n{\"question\": \"Steve puts $100 into the bank. Each year he earns 10% interest on the money in the account. How much money will be in the bank after 2 years?\", \"answer\": \"At the end of the first year, there will be $100 * (110/100) = $<<100*110/100=110>>110 in the bank account.\\nAt the end of the second year, there will be $110 * (110/100) = $<<110*(110/100)=121>>121\\n#### 121\"}\n{\"question\": \"The balance of Pam's bank account tripled during the year. At the end of the year, Pam withdrew $250. If her current balance is $950, how much did she have in the bank account at the beginning of the year?\", \"answer\": \"First, we have to come up with the balance before her withdrawal. $950 (current) + $250 (withdraw) = $<<950+250=1200>>1200.\\nNow since we know that is triple, we divide by 3. $1200 / 3 = $<<1200/3=400>>400\\n#### 400\"}"
