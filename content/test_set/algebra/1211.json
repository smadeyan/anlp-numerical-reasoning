    "problem": "Consider the function $g(x)=3x-4$.  For what value of $a$ is $g(a)=0$?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since $g(a) = 3a-4$, the equation $g(a)=0$ means $3a-4=0$.  Solving this equation gives $a = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{3}}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Anna spent 1/4 of her money, and now she has $24 left. How much did she have originally?\", \"answer\": \"Let X be the amount Anna had originally. She spent X*1/4 and has X - X*1/4 = $24 left.\\nCombining like terms, we get X*3/4 = $24.\\nDividing both sides by 3/4, we get X = $32.\\n#### 32\"}\n{\"question\": \"Samantha, Aira, and Joe received 6 rubber bands each after they divided their bands equally.  If Samantha had 5 more bands than Aira and Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe, how many rubber bands did Aira have?\", \"answer\": \"Samantha, Aira, and Joe have 6 x 3 = <<6*3=18>>18 rubber bands altogether.\\nIf we let x be the number of bands that Aira had, then Samantha had x + 5.\\nSince Aira had 1 fewer band than Joe, then Joe had x + 1.\\nSince the total number of bands is 18, then the equation is x + (x + 5) + (x + 1) = 18.\\nBy simplifying the left side of the equation, we have 3x + 6 = <<3*+6=18>>18.\\nPutting all the constant terms on the right side gives 3x = 12.\\nSo the value of x is 12/3 = 4. Hence, Aira had 4 rubber bands.\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Emily went to the store and bought art supplies for $20 and 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money. She spent a total of $50. How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\", \"answer\": \"First, you need to set up the problem with the information given. The cost of the skirts and art supplies must equal $<<50=50>>50.\\nSince we know that the cost of the skirts is the same price and that she bought art supplies for $20, we can set up an equation: 2x + 20 = 50, with x being the cost of the skirts.\\nTo solve the equation, subtract 20 from both sides, to give you the new equation: 2x = 30.\\nSolve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, 2x/2 = 30/2 gives you x = 15.\\nTherefore, each skirt cost $<<15=15>>15.\\n#### 15\"}\n{\"question\": \"Hendricks buys a guitar for $200, which is 20% less than what Gerald bought the same guitar for. How much did Gerald pay for his guitar?\", \"answer\": \"Let G be the price Gerald paid for his guitar.\\nThen 0.8 * G = $200\\nSo G = $200 / 0.8 = $<<200/0.8=250>>250\\n#### 250\"}"
