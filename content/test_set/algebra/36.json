    "problem": "A scale drawing of a park shows that one inch represents 800 feet. A line segment in the drawing that is 4.75 inches long represents how many feet?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Each inch of the 4.75-inch line segment represents 800 feet, so the whole line segment represents $4.75\\times800=\\frac{19}{4}\\cdot800=19\\cdot200=\\boxed{3800}$ feet.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?\", \"answer\": \"If 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles on real land, 1 inch represents 4 * 8 = 32 miles.\\nSince 1 inch represents 32 miles, 3 inches represent 3 * 32 = <<3*32=96>>96 miles.\\n1/ 4 inch represents 8 miles, 1/8 inch represents 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 miles because 1/8 is half of 1/4.\\nIf 1/8 inch represents 4 miles, 3/8 of an inch represents 3 * 4 = 12 miles.\\nThis means 3 3/8 inches on the map translate to 96 + 12 = 108 miles.\\n#### 108\"}\n{\"question\": \"A park is 1000 feet long and 2000 feet wide. If there is 1 tree per 20 square feet, how many trees are there in the park?\", \"answer\": \"The park is 2,000,000 square feet because 1000*2000 =<<1000*2000=2000000>>2,000,000.\\nThus, there are 100,000 trees in the park because 2,000,000/20 = <<2000000/20=100000>>100,000.\\n#### 100,000\"}\n{\"question\": \"The height of the tree in Kilmer Park is 52 feet. Each year it grows 5 feet. In 8 years, what will the height of the tree be in inches, assuming 1 foot is 12 inches.\", \"answer\": \"In 8 years, the tree will have grown 5*8 = <<5*8=40>>40 feet.\\nIn 8 years, the tree will be 52+40 = <<52+40=92>>92 feet.\\nIn 8 years, the tree will be 92*12 = <<92*12=1104>>1104 inches.\\n#### 1104\"}\n{\"question\": \"You draw a rectangle that is 7 inches wide. It is 4 times as long as it is wide. What is the area of the rectangle?\", \"answer\": \"The length of the rectangle is 4 * 7 inches = <<4*7=28>>28 inches.\\nThe area of the rectangle is 7 inches * 28 inches = <<7*28=196>>196 square inches.\\n#### 196\"}"
