Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"The area of a forest is three times the area of the square-shaped street.
