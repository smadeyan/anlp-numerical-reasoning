    "problem": "Find the non-zero value of $c$ for which there is exactly one positive value of $b$ for which there is one solution to the equation $x^2 + \\left(b + \\frac 1b\\right)x + c = 0$.",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "The discriminant of the given quadratic equation is $\\left(b+\\frac 1b\\right)^2 - 4c$. For the quadratic to have one root, it follows that the discriminant must be equal to zero, so $b^2 + 2 - 4c + \\frac 1{b^2} = 0$. We are also given that there should be exactly one positive value $b$ satisfying this equation. Multiplying through by $b^2$ (for we know that $b \\neq 0$) yields that $b^4 + (2-4c)b^2 + 1 = 0$; this is a quadratic equation in $b^2$ that has discriminant $(2-4c)^2 - 4$. Again, this discriminant must be equal to zero, so $(2-4c)^2 = 4 \\Longrightarrow 2-4c = \\pm 2$. The non-zero value of $c$ satisfying this equation is $c = \\boxed{1}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"Viggo spent $80 on a shirt. He paid the shirt using $20 and $10 bills. If she gave the clerk one more $20 bill than $10 bills, how many $10 bills did he give?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the number of $10 bills.\\nSo, there are (x + 1) $20 bills.\\nAdding the $10 and $20 bills should sum up to $80 so the equation is 10x + 20(x + 1) = 80.\\nThen, distribute 20 to x + 1 so it becomes 10x + 20x + 20 = 80.\\nCombining the like terms on the left side gives 30x + 20 = 80.\\nThen transfer 20 to the right side of the equation, so it becomes 30x = 60.\\nTo solve for x, we have 60/30 = <<60/30=2>>2.\\nTherefore, there are 2 $10 bills.\\n#### 2\"}\n{\"question\": \"Emily went to the store and bought art supplies for $20 and 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money. She spent a total of $50. How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\", \"answer\": \"First, you need to set up the problem with the information given. The cost of the skirts and art supplies must equal $<<50=50>>50.\\nSince we know that the cost of the skirts is the same price and that she bought art supplies for $20, we can set up an equation: 2x + 20 = 50, with x being the cost of the skirts.\\nTo solve the equation, subtract 20 from both sides, to give you the new equation: 2x = 30.\\nSolve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, 2x/2 = 30/2 gives you x = 15.\\nTherefore, each skirt cost $<<15=15>>15.\\n#### 15\"}\n{\"question\": \"Josette bought 3 bottles of mineral water for \\u20ac1.50. How much will four bottles cost?\", \"answer\": \"A bottle costs 1.50 \\u20ac / 3 = <<1.50/3=0.50>>0.50 \\u20ac.\\nSo, four bottles cost 0.50 \\u20ac * 4 = <<0.50*4=2>>2 \\u20ac.\\n#### 2\"}"
