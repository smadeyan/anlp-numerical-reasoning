    "problem": "Let $a^2=\\frac{16}{44}$ and $b^2=\\frac{(2+\\sqrt{5})^2}{11}$, where $a$ is a negative real number and $b$ is a positive real number. If $(a+b)^3$ can be expressed in the simplified form $\\frac{x\\sqrt{y}}{z}$ where $x$, $y$, and $z$ are positive integers, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$?",

    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "First we solve for $a$ and $b$. $$a=-\\sqrt{\\frac{16}{44}}=-\\frac{\\sqrt{16}}{\\sqrt{44}}=-\\frac{4}{2\\sqrt{11}}=-\\frac2{\\sqrt{11}}$$$$b=\\sqrt{\\frac{(2+\\sqrt{5})^2}{11}}=\\frac{2+\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}}$$Now we solve for $(a+b)^3$. \\begin{align*}(a+b)^3&=\\left(-\\frac2{\\sqrt{11}}+\\frac{2+\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}}\\right)^3=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{\\sqrt{11}}\\right)^3=\\frac{\\sqrt{5^3}}{\\sqrt{11^3}}\\\\\n&=\\frac{5\\sqrt{5}}{11\\sqrt{11}}=\\frac{5\\sqrt{5}}{11\\sqrt{11}}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{11}}{\\sqrt{11}}=\\frac{5\\sqrt{55}}{121}\n\\end{align*}So, $x+y+z=5+55+121=\\boxed{181}$.",

The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?\", \"answer\": \"Let her previous monthly income be p\\nThe cost of her rent and utilities was 40% of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5\\nHer income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600\\nThe cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4\\nEquating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4\\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000\\nSubtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000\\nDividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000\\n#### 1000\"}"
