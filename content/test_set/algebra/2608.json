    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "We can find this answer by plugging 5 into the function: \\begin{align*} f(5)& = \\dfrac{5+1}{3(5)-4}\n\\\\ & = \\dfrac{6}{15-4}\n\\\\ & = \\boxed{\\dfrac{6}{11}}\n\\end{align*}",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Anna spent 1/4 of her money, and now she has $24 left. How much did she have originally?\", \"answer\": \"Let X be the amount Anna had originally. She spent X*1/4 and has X - X*1/4 = $24 left.\\nCombining like terms, we get X*3/4 = $24.\\nDividing both sides by 3/4, we get X = $32.\\n#### 32\"}\n{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"Fifteen more than a quarter of a number is 27. What is the number?\", \"answer\": \"A quarter of the number is 27-15=<<27-15=12>>12.\\nThe number is 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48.\\n#### 48\"}"
