    "problem": "Of the five points (3, 10), (6, 20), (12, 35), (18, 40) and (20, 50), what is the sum of the $x$-coordinates of the points that lie in the region above the line $y = 2x + 7$ in the coordinate plane?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "A point lies above $y=2x+7$ if its $y$-coordinate is greater than 2 times its $x$-coordinate plus 7.  Checking the given points, we find that $(6,20)$, $(12,35)$, and $(20,50)$ satisfy this condition.  The sum of the $x$-coordinates of these points is $6+12+20=\\boxed{38}$.",

Find the value of the triangle base if the left side has a value of 12 cm.\", \"answer\": \"If the left side of the triangle is 12, and the right side is 2 cm longer, the right side is 12+2 = <<12+2=14>>14 cm long.\\nThe sum of the left and right sides of the triangle is 14+12 = <<14+12=26>>26 cm.\\nIf the sum of all sides of the is 50, and the left and right sides of the triangle are 26, the triangle base is 50-26 = <<50-26=24>>24 cm.\\n#### 24\"}\n{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"Alia has 2 times as many markers as Austin.
