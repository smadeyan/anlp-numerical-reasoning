    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"Anna spent 1/4 of her money, and now she has $24 left. How much did she have originally?\", \"answer\": \"Let X be the amount Anna had originally. She spent X*1/4 and has X - X*1/4 = $24 left.\\nCombining like terms, we get X*3/4 = $24.\\nDividing both sides by 3/4, we get X = $32.\\n#### 32\"}\n{\"question\": \"Viggo spent $80 on a shirt. He paid the shirt using $20 and $10 bills. If she gave the clerk one more $20 bill than $10 bills, how many $10 bills did he give?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the number of $10 bills.\\nSo, there are (x + 1) $20 bills.\\nAdding the $10 and $20 bills should sum up to $80 so the equation is 10x + 20(x + 1) = 80.\\nThen, distribute 20 to x + 1 so it becomes 10x + 20x + 20 = 80.\\nCombining the like terms on the left side gives 30x + 20 = 80.\\nThen transfer 20 to the right side of the equation, so it becomes 30x = 60.\\nTo solve for x, we have 60/30 = <<60/30=2>>2.\\nTherefore, there are 2 $10 bills.\\n#### 2\"}"
