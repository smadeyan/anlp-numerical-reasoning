    "problem": "Samson derives utility according the relation  $$\\text{Utility} = \\text{hours of math done} \\times \\text{hours of frisbee played}.$$On Monday he plays $t$ hours of frisbee and spends $8 - t$ hours doing math.  On Tuesday, he ends up getting the same amount of utility as Monday while spending $2-t$ hours playing frisbee and $t+3$ hours on math.  Find $t$.  Answer as a fraction in lowest terms.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Algebra",
    "solution": "Since he derived equal utility from both days, we have $$t (8 - t) = (2 - t)(t + 3),$$so $$8t - t^2 = -t^2 -t + 6.$$Simplifying gives $t = \\boxed{\\frac{2}{3}}$.",

How long does he spend on his chores?\", \"answer\": \"He spends 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 hours on his other chores\\nSo he spends 3+9=<<3+9=12>>12 hours on chores\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"Oliver had $9, then he saved $5 from his allowance and spent $4 on a frisbee and $3 on a puzzle. His friend gives him another $8 as it's his birthday. How much money does Oliver have left?\", \"answer\": \"The total amount of money saved is $9 + $5 = $<<9+5=14>>14.\\nThe total cost of the frisbee and the puzzle is $4 + $3 = $<<4+3=7>>7.\\nSo Oliver has $14 - $7 = $<<14-7=7>>7 left.\\nHis friend gives him $8, so now he has $7 + $8 = $<<7+8=15>>15.\\n#### 15\"}\n{\"question\": \"Adam goes to school every day. On Monday he had 6 lessons of 30 minutes each, and on Tuesday he had 3 lessons of 1 hour each. On Wednesday, Adam spent twice as much time at school as on Tuesday. How much time in total did Adam spend at school during these 3 days, in hours?\", \"answer\": \"On Monday Adam had 6 * 30 = <<6*30=180>>180 minutes of lessons, which is 3 hours.\\nOn Wednesday Adam spent twice as much time at school as on Tuesday, so he spent 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours at school.\\nThis means that during these three days Adam spent at school 3 + 3 + 6 = <<3+3+6=12>>12 hours.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"Roy spends 2 hours on sports activities in school every day.
