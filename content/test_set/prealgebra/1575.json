    "problem": "What is the value of $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{8}$?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Using a common deminator of 8, $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{3}{8} = \\boxed{\\frac{5}{8}}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Anna spent 1/4 of her money, and now she has $24 left. How much did she have originally?\", \"answer\": \"Let X be the amount Anna had originally. She spent X*1/4 and has X - X*1/4 = $24 left.\\nCombining like terms, we get X*3/4 = $24.\\nDividing both sides by 3/4, we get X = $32.\\n#### 32\"}\n{\"question\": \"Fifteen more than a quarter of a number is 27. What is the number?\", \"answer\": \"A quarter of the number is 27-15=<<27-15=12>>12.\\nThe number is 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48.\\n#### 48\"}\n{\"question\": \"Rica's group won in a dance competition. She got 3/8 of the prize money. From Rica's prize money, she spent 1/5 of it and is now left with $300. How much was the prize money that her group won?\", \"answer\": \"Rica is left with 1 - 1/5 = 4/5 of her prize money which is equal to $300.\\nSince 4/5 is worth $300, then 1/5 is worth $300/4 = $75.\\nSo, Rica got $75 x 5 = $375 from their prize money which is 3/8 of the total prize.\\nSince 3/8 is equal to $375, then 1/8 is worth $375/3 = $125.\\nSo, the total prize money is $125 x 8 = $<<125*8=1000>>1000.\\n#### 1000\"}"
