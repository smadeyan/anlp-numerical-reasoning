    "solution": "The area of a triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\text{base})(\\text{height})$, so the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(8\\text{ cm})(\\text{10 cm})=\\boxed{40}$ square centimeters.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"The area of a triangle with a given base and height is given by 1/2*base*height. What is the base length of a triangle with height 8 and area 24 square units?\", \"answer\": \"Let b be the base of the triangle\\n(1/2)*b*8=24.\\n4*b=24\\nb=<<6=6>>6\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\", \"answer\": \"To get the perimeter, you add all the sides o the triangles, so the first two sides add up to 40+50 = <<40+50=90>>90 cm.\\nIf the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160-90 = <<160-90=70>>70 cm.\\n#### 70\"}\n{\"question\": \"The perimeter of a square-shaped piece of paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of a computer screen. How many cm is the height of the screen if the side of the square paper is 20 cm?\", \"answer\": \"The perimeter of a square is found by 4*side, which means the square paper has a perimeter of 4*20 = <<4*20=80>>80\\nSince the perimeter of the square is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen, the height of the computer screen is 20+80 = <<20+80=100>>100cm.\\n#### 100\"}\n{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}"
