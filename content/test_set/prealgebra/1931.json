    "problem": "There are 20 people in my club.  8 of them are left-handed.  15 of them like jazz music.  2 of them are right-handed and dislike jazz music.  How many club members are left-handed and like jazz music? Assume people are either left-handed or right-handed, but not both.",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Let the number of lefty jazz lovers be $x$.  So $8-x$ lefties dislike jazz and $15-x$ jazz lovers are righties.  Since the number of righty jazz dislikers is 2 and the total number of members of the club is 20, we can add these four exclusive categories to get $x + (8 - x) + (15 - x) + 2 = 20$, so $x = \\boxed{5}$, which is the number of lefty jazz lovers.",

There are eight fewer trombone players than trumpeters, and eleven more drummers than trombone players. There are twice as many members that play the clarinet as members that play the flute. Three more members play the French horn than play the trombone. How many seats are needed on the bus?\", \"answer\": \"There are 3 trumpets/flute x 5 flutes = <<3*5=15>>15 trumpet players\\nThere are 15 players - 8 players = <<15-8=7>>7 trombone players\\nThere are 7 players + 11 players = <<7+11=18>>18 drummers.\\nThere are 2 clarinets/flute x 5 flutes = 10 clarinet players\\nThere are 7 players + 3 players = <<7+3=10>>10 French horn players\\nIn total 5 players + 15 players + 7 players + 18 players + 10 players + 10 players = <<5+15+7+18+10+10=65>>65 seats needed.\\n#### 65\"}\n{\"question\": \"Miles is a musician.  He owns three fewer trumpets than he has fingers, and two more guitars than he has hands.  He also owns two more trombones than he has heads, and one fewer French horn than he has guitars.
