    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"The three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  The largest angle is 5 times bigger than the smallest. The middle angle is 3 times bigger than the smallest. How many degrees is the smallest angle?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the smallest angle.\\nThe combination of the three is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.\\nThus 9x = 180.\\nSo x = <<20=20>>20.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"In a triangle with angles A, B, and C, A is 60 degrees, and B is two times as big as C. Calculate the angle of B.\", \"answer\": \"Since the angles in a triangle adds up to 180, and A is 40 degrees, B and C have a total of 180-60 = <<180-60=120>>120 degrees.\\nSince B is two times bigger than C, the total of the angles of B and C is equal to 2C+C = 120\\n3C=120\\nThe angle of C is C=120/3\\nC is <<40=40>>40\\nSince B is two times as big as C, B is 2*40 = 80 degrees.\\n#### 80\"}\n{\"question\": \"The sum of the three angles of a triangle equals 250. The left angle is twice the right angle's value, and the right angle is 60 degrees. Find the value of the top angle?\", \"answer\": \"Since the left angle is twice the value of the right angle, the left angle is 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 degrees.\\nThe total value of the left and right angles is 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 degrees.\\nSince the sum of the three angles is equal to 250, the other angle has a value of 250-180 = <<250-180=70>>70 degrees.\\n#### 70\"}\n{\"question\": \"A long wire is cut into three smaller pieces in the ratio of 7:3:2. If the shortest piece is 16 cm, how long was the entire wire before it was cut?\", \"answer\": \"Since the shortest part is consists of 2 parts, then each part is equal to 16 cm/2 = 8 cm.\\nThe whole wire was cut into 7 + 3 + 2 = <<7+3+2=12>>12 parts.\\nHence, the wire was 8 cm x 12 = <<8*12=96>>96 cm long\\n#### 96\"}"
