    "problem": "A piece of string fits exactly once around the perimeter of a square whose area is 144.  Rounded to the nearest whole number, what is the area of the largest circle that can be formed from the piece of string?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since the area of the square is 144, each side has length $\\sqrt{144}=12$.  The length of the string equals the perimeter of the square which is $4 \\times 12=48$.  The largest circle that can be formed from this string has a circumference of 48 or $2\\pi r=48$.  Solving for the radius $r$, we get $r=\\frac{48}{2\\pi} = \\frac{24}{\\pi}$. Therefore, the maximum area of a circle that can be formed using the string is $\\pi \\cdot \\left( \\frac{24}{\\pi} \\right)^2 = \\frac{576}{\\pi} \\approx \\boxed{183}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"Hunter needs to make a square patch of land whose perimeter is twice as large as a rectangular patch of land. If the rectangular patch of land has a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet, calculate the length of one side of the square patch of land.\", \"answer\": \"If the rectangular patch of land measures 400 feet by 300 feet, the total length around it or its perimeter is given by 2 * 400 + 2 * 300 = 800 + 600 = <<2*400+2*300=1400>>1400\\nThe square patch's perimeter is double that length, so it's 1400 * 2 = <<1400*2=2800>>2800\\nSince the square has four equal sides, one side of the square patch of land will have a length of 2800/4 = <<2800/4=700>>700 feet\\n#### 700\"}\n{\"question\": \"Bailey is making a rectangle out of a 100cm length of rope he has. If the longer sides of the rectangle were 28cm long, what is the length of each of the shorter sides?\", \"answer\": \"The longer sides are 2 in number so their total length of 2*28cm = <<2*28=56>>56cm\\nThe rest of the length making up the short sides is 100-56 = <<100-56=44>>44 cm\\nThere are two equal short sides so each one is 44/2 = <<44/2=22>>22cm\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"If a circle has a radius of 14 feet, how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle?\", \"answer\": \"A circle with a radius of 14 feet has a diameter of 2*14=<<14*2=28>>28 feet.\\nA six-inch pencil is 6/12=<<6/12=0.5>>0.5 feet long.\\nThus, across a 28-foot diameter, one can place 28/0.5=<<28/0.5=56>>56 6-inch pencils.\\n#### 56\"}"
