    "problem": "Van was asked to add 46 to 37 and round the result to the nearest ten. He figured that since he was going to have to round anyway, he might as well do it before adding the numbers. He rounded 46 to 50 and 37 to 40, thus getting an answer of $50+40=90$. This answer is not correct. What is the correct answer?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If we add 46 and 37, we get 83. Rounding 83 to the nearest ten gives $\\boxed{80}$ since 83 is closer to 80 than it is to 90.\n\nNote: Van's mistake of rounding before arriving at the final answer is a common one. It is called \"intermediate rounding.\"",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Kendall is counting her change. She has a total of $4 in quarters, dimes, and nickels. If she has 10 quarters and 12 dimes, how many nickels does she have?\", \"answer\": \"The total money from the quarters is 10 * $0.25 = $<<10*0.25=2.50>>2.50\\nThe total money from the dimes is 12 * $0.10 = $<<12*0.10=1.20>>1.20\\nThe total money from the nickels is $4 - $2.50 - $1.20 = $<<4-2.5-1.2=0.30>>0.30\\nThe number of nickels Kendall has is $0.30 / $0.05 = <<0.30/0.05=6>>6 nickels\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"Lorie has 2 pieces of $100 bills. He requested to change one piece of the $100 bills into $50 bills. Half of the remaining $100 bill is changed to $10 bills while the rest is changed to $5 bills. How many pieces of bills will she have?\", \"answer\": \"There will be $100/$50 = <<100/50=2>>2 pieces of $50 when $100 is changed to $50 bills.\\nHalf of $100 is $100/2 = $<<100/2=50>>50.\\nSo there will be $50/$10 = <<50/10=5>>5 pieces of $10 when $50 is changed to $10 bills.\\nThe remaining $50 will be changed to $5 bills so there will be $50/$5 = <<50/5=10>>10 pieces of $5 bills.\\nSo in total, Lorie will have 2 $50 bills + 5 $10 bills + 10 $5 bills = <<2+5+10=17>>17 pieces of bills.\\n#### 17\"}\n{\"question\": \"Darrel has 76 quarters, 85 dimes, 20 nickels and 150 pennies.  If he drops all of his money into a coin-counting machine, they will convert his change into dollars for a 10% fee.

The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}"
