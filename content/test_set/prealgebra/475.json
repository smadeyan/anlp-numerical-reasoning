    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Plugging the known value of $w$ into the third given equation, we find that $z=100$. Plugging $z$ into the second given equation, we find that $y=110$. Plugging $y$ into the first given equation gives $x=\\boxed{115}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"Emily went to the store and bought art supplies for $20 and 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money. She spent a total of $50. How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\", \"answer\": \"First, you need to set up the problem with the information given. The cost of the skirts and art supplies must equal $<<50=50>>50.\\nSince we know that the cost of the skirts is the same price and that she bought art supplies for $20, we can set up an equation: 2x + 20 = 50, with x being the cost of the skirts.\\nTo solve the equation, subtract 20 from both sides, to give you the new equation: 2x = 30.\\nSolve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, 2x/2 = 30/2 gives you x = 15.\\nTherefore, each skirt cost $<<15=15>>15.\\n#### 15\"}\n{\"question\": \"Aubrie has four cards with the labels W, X, Y, Z printed on them. W is tagged with the number 200, X is tagged with half the number W is tagged with, Y is tagged with the total of X and W's tags and Z is tagged with the number 400. Calculate the total of all the tagged numbers.\", \"answer\": \"If the card with the letter X has half the number the card with letter W has, it has 1/2*200= 100\\nTogether, cards with letters W and X have tags that total 100+200 = <<100+200=300>>300.\\nIf the card with the letter Y has the total of the numbers cards with letters, W and X have, then the total for cards with letters W, X, and Y is 300+300 = 600\\nSince the card with the letter Z has a tag of 200, the total of the numbers the tags have is 600+400= 1000\\n#### 1000\"}"
