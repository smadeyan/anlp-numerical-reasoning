    "solution": "From the given graph, it is visible that the student headcount in spring of `02-`03 was 10,900 students, in spring of `03-`04 the headcount was 10,500, and in spring of `04-`05, the headcount was  10,700.

    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"In my school, the number of students has increased by 20% this year. The number of students this year is 960. How many students were there last year?\", \"answer\": \"Let X be the number of students last year. The number of students this year is X+X*20% = 960\\nCombining like terms, we get X*1.2 = 960\\nDividing both sides by 1.2, we get X = 800 students.\\n#### 800\"}\n{\"question\": \"At the beginning of an academic year, there were 15 boys in a class and the number of girls was 20% greater. Later in the year, transfer students were admitted such that the number of girls doubled but the number of boys remained the same. How many students are in the class now?\", \"answer\": \"The original number of girls was 20% greater than 15 (the number of boys) giving 15+(20/100)*15 = <<15+(20/100)*15=18>>18\\nAfter the admission of transfer students, the number of girls doubled to become 18*2 = <<18*2=36>>36\\nIn addition to the 15 boys, there are now 15+36 = <<15+36=51>>51 students in the class\\n#### 51\"}\n{\"question\": \"Mr. Angstadt has 120 students throughout the school day.
