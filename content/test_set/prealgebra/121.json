    "solution": "Drawing an altitude of an equilateral triangle splits it into two 30-60-90 right triangles: [asy]\nunitsize(0.6inch);\npair A, B, C, F;\nA = (0,1);\nB = rotate(120)*A;\nC = rotate(120)*B;\nF = foot(A,B,C);\ndraw(A--B--C--A,linewidth(1));\ndraw(A--F);\n[/asy]\n\nThe altitude is the longer leg of each 30-60-90 triangle, and the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle, so the altitude's length is $\\sqrt{3}/2$ times the side length of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the altitude of the equilateral triangle in the problem is $8(\\sqrt{3}/2) = 4\\sqrt{3}$, so the area of the equilateral triangle is $(8)(4\\sqrt{3})/2 = 16\\sqrt{3}$. The perimeter of the triangle is $3 \\cdot 8 = 24$. Thus, the ratio of area to perimeter is $\\frac{16\\sqrt{3}}{24}=\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}.$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"The area of a triangle with a given base and height is given by 1/2*base*height.

If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\", \"answer\": \"To get the perimeter, you add all the sides o the triangles, so the first two sides add up to 40+50 = <<40+50=90>>90 cm.\\nIf the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160-90 = <<160-90=70>>70 cm.\\n#### 70\"}\n{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?\", \"answer\": \"A triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2 square inches because (1/2) x 2 x 2 = <<(1/2)*2*2=2>>2\\nThe square has an area of 4 square inches because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4\\n2 triangles would fit because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2\\n#### 2\"}"
