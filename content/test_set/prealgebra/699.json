    "problem": "In the six-digit integer $3A6,\\!792$, what is the largest digit $A$ so that the six-digit integer will be divisible by 3?",
    "level": "Level 1",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "The sum of the digits of the integer is $A+27$, so the integer is divisible by $3$ if $A$ is 0, 3, 6, or 9, since these are the only possible values of the digit $A$ that make $A + 27$ divisible by 3. The largest of these is $\\boxed{9}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"There are 3 consecutive odd integers that have a sum of -147. What is the largest number?\", \"answer\": \"Let N = smallest number\\nN + 2 = next number\\nN + 4 = largest number\\nN + (N + 2) + (N + 4) = -147\\n3N + 6 = -147\\n3N = <<-153=-153>>-153\\nN = -51\\nThe largest number is <<-47=-47>>-47.\\n#### -47\"}\n{\"question\": \"There are 3 numbers that are consecutive integers.

W is tagged with the number 200, X is tagged with half the number W is tagged with, Y is tagged with the total of X and W's tags and Z is tagged with the number 400. Calculate the total of all the tagged numbers.\", \"answer\": \"If the card with the letter X has half the number the card with letter W has, it has 1/2*200= 100\\nTogether, cards with letters W and X have tags that total 100+200 = <<100+200=300>>300.\\nIf the card with the letter Y has the total of the numbers cards with letters, W and X have, then the total for cards with letters W, X, and Y is 300+300 = 600\\nSince the card with the letter Z has a tag of 200, the total of the numbers the tags have is 600+400= 1000\\n#### 1000\"}\n{\"question\": \"Armand is playing a guessing game with his dad where he has to guess a number his dad is thinking of. His dad tells him that the number, when multiplied by 3, is three less than twice 51. What is the number?\", \"answer\": \"102 is twice 51 because 2 x 51 = <<2*51=102>>102\\nThree less than 102 is 99 because 102 -3 = <<102-3=99>>99\\nThe number is 33 because 99 / 3 = <<99/3=33>>33\\n#### 33\"}"
