Also, $QX=PT=6$.\n\nSince $TS=7$ and $TX=3$, then $XS=TS-TX=7-3=4$.\n\nSince $QX=6$ and $QR=3$, then $RX=QX-QR=6-3=3$.\n\nSince $PQXT$ is a rectangle, then $\\angle RXS=90^\\circ$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem in $\\triangle RXS$, \\[ RS^2 = RX^2 + XS^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9+16=25 \\]so $RS=5$, since $RS>0$.\n\nTherefore, the perimeter is $$PQ+QR+RS+ST+TP=3+3+5+7+6=\\boxed{24}.$$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"Bailey is making a rectangle out of a 100cm length of rope he has. If the longer sides of the rectangle were 28cm long, what is the length of each of the shorter sides?\", \"answer\": \"The longer sides are 2 in number so their total length of 2*28cm = <<2*28=56>>56cm\\nThe rest of the length making up the short sides is 100-56 = <<100-56=44>>44 cm\\nThere are two equal short sides so each one is 44/2 = <<44/2=22>>22cm\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"Hunter needs to make a square patch of land whose perimeter is twice as large as a rectangular patch of land. If the rectangular patch of land has a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet, calculate the length of one side of the square patch of land.\", \"answer\": \"If the rectangular patch of land measures 400 feet by 300 feet, the total length around it or its perimeter is given by 2 * 400 + 2 * 300 = 800 + 600 = <<2*400+2*300=1400>>1400\\nThe square patch's perimeter is double that length, so it's 1400 * 2 = <<1400*2=2800>>2800\\nSince the square has four equal sides, one side of the square patch of land will have a length of 2800/4 = <<2800/4=700>>700 feet\\n#### 700\"}"
