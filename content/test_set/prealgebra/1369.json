    "problem": "Joe wants to find all the four-letter words that begin and end with the same letter. How many combinations of letters satisfy this property?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "There are $26$ choices for the first letter, $26$ for the second, and $26$ for the third. The last letter is determined by the first letter. Thus, there are $26^3 = \\boxed{17576}$ such combinations.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"James' keyboard is missing 1/7 of the consonants and two vowels. How many keys are missing in total? (Remember there are 5 vowels and 21 consonants in the alphabet.)\", \"answer\": \"First find how many consonants are missing: 21 consonants * 1/7 = <<21*1/7=3>>3 consonants\\nThen add the number of missing vowels to find the total number of missing keys: 3 consonants + 2 vowels = <<3+2=5>>5 keys\\n#### 5\"}\n{\"question\": \"Jonathan's full name contains 8 letters for the first name and 10 letters for the surname. His sister's name has 5 letters for the first name and 10 letters for the second name.

He once played a three-letter word on a triple word score to earn thirty points.  If before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, how much was the middle letter valued at before the word score was tripled?\", \"answer\": \"Since the word score after being tripled was 30 points, then the word score before tripling was 30/3=<<30/3=10>>10 points.\\nIf before the word score was tripled, the first and third letters were each valued at one point apiece, then the value of the middle letter was 10-1-1=<<10-1-1=8>>8 points.\\n#### 8\"}"
