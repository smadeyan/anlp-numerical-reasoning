    "problem": "At the end of the day, a bakery had $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie left over. Louie, Duey and Huey split the pie, with each taking home the same amount of leftover pie. How much pie did Louie take home?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "Since there are $3$ people who took home pieces of $\\frac{6}{7}$ of a pie, we must divide $\\frac{6}{7}$ by $3$. \\[\n\\frac{6}{7} \\div 3 = \\frac{6}{7} \\div \\frac{3}{1} = \\frac{6}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 1}{7 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{6}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{7} = \\frac{2}{7}.\n\\] Therefore Louie, Duey, and Huey each took home $\\frac{2}{7}$ of a pie, and as such, Louie took home $\\boxed{\\frac{2}{7}}\\text{ of a pie}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Marcus can fit 5 pies in his oven at once. He bakes 7 batches of pies, then slips and drops 8 of them. How many pies are left?\", \"answer\": \"First find the total number of pies Marcus bakes: 5 pies/batch * 7 batches = <<5*7=35>>35 pies\\nThen subtract the number of pies Marcus drops: 35 pies - 8 pies = <<35-8=27>>27 pies\\n#### 27\"}\n{\"question\": \"Smith\\u2019s Bakery sold 6 more than four times the number of pies that Mcgee\\u2019s Bakery sold.
