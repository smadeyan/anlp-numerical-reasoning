    "problem": "The hypotenuse of a right triangle measures $6\\sqrt{2}$ inches and one angle is $45^{\\circ}$. What is the number of square inches in the area of the triangle?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Prealgebra",
    "solution": "If one acute angle of a right triangle is $45^\\circ$, then the other is $90^\\circ-45^\\circ =45^\\circ$, so the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle.  The hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the length of each leg, so each leg has 6.  Therefore, the area of the triangle is $(6)(6)/2 = \\boxed{18}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"The area of a triangle with a given base and height is given by 1/2*base*height.

If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\", \"answer\": \"To get the perimeter, you add all the sides o the triangles, so the first two sides add up to 40+50 = <<40+50=90>>90 cm.\\nIf the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160-90 = <<160-90=70>>70 cm.\\n#### 70\"}"
