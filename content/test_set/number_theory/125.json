    "problem": "What is the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 10 and 110?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Any odd multiple of 5 will end in a units digit of 5 (even multiples will end in a units digit of 0). Since all the integers we are multiplying are odd and some of them have a factor of 5, the product will be an odd multiple of 5 with a units digit of $\\boxed{5}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Aubrie has four cards with the labels W, X, Y, Z printed on them. W is tagged with the number 200, X is tagged with half the number W is tagged with, Y is tagged with the total of X and W's tags and Z is tagged with the number 400. Calculate the total of all the tagged numbers.\", \"answer\": \"If the card with the letter X has half the number the card with letter W has, it has 1/2*200= 100\\nTogether, cards with letters W and X have tags that total 100+200 = <<100+200=300>>300.\\nIf the card with the letter Y has the total of the numbers cards with letters, W and X have, then the total for cards with letters W, X, and Y is 300+300 = 600\\nSince the card with the letter Z has a tag of 200, the total of the numbers the tags have is 600+400= 1000\\n#### 1000\"}\n{\"question\": \"There are 3 consecutive odd integers that have a sum of -147. What is the largest number?\", \"answer\": \"Let N = smallest number\\nN + 2 = next number\\nN + 4 = largest number\\nN + (N + 2) + (N + 4) = -147\\n3N + 6 = -147\\n3N = <<-153=-153>>-153\\nN = -51\\nThe largest number is <<-47=-47>>-47.\\n#### -47\"}\n{\"question\": \"Fifteen more than a quarter of a number is 27. What is the number?\", \"answer\": \"A quarter of the number is 27-15=<<27-15=12>>12.\\nThe number is 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48.\\n#### 48\"}\n{\"question\": \"A special school has a deaf-student population 3 times its blind-student population. If there are 180 students in total, how many blind students are there?\", \"answer\": \"Let the number of blind students be x.\\nThe number of deaf students will then be 3*x = 3x students.\\nThe total number of students is x + 3x = 180 students.\\nCombining like terms gives 4x = 180.\\nSo the value of x is 180/4 = <<180/4=45>>45.\\n#### 45\"}"
