    "problem": "Winnie has 17 red balloons, 33 white balloons, 65 green balloons, and 83 chartreuse balloons.  With no regard to color, Winnie gives each of her 8 nearest and dearest friends some balloons.  Each friend gets the same number of balloons and she hands out as many balloons as possible.  How many balloons does Winnie end up keeping for herself?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We want to know the remainder when $17+33+65+83$ is divided by 8.  The remainders of each of these numbers are easy to compute individually so we can say \\[17+33+65+83\\equiv1+1+1+3\\equiv6\\pmod8.\\]Therefore Winnie has $\\boxed{6}$ balloons left over after giving out her balloons.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"There were 672 balloons that were either green, blue, yellow, or red. They were divided into equal groups and then Anya took half of the yellow ones home. How many balloons did Anya take home?\", \"answer\": \"672/4 = <<672/4=168>>168 balloons\\n168 * (1/2) = <<168*(1/2)=84>>84 balloons\\nAnya took 84 balloons home.\\n#### 84\"}\n{\"question\": \"Janeth bought 5 bags of round balloons with 20 balloons in each bag. She also bought 4 bags of long balloons with 30 balloons in each bag. While blowing up the balloons, 5 round balloons burst. How many balloons are left?\", \"answer\": \"Janeth bought 5 x 20 = <<5*20=100>>100 round balloons.\\nShe bought 4 x 30 = <<4*30=120>>120 long balloons.\\nSo, she has a total of 100 + 120 = <<100+120=220>>220 balloons.\\nSince 5 round balloons burst, then there are only 220 - 5 = <<220-5=215>>215 balloons left.\\n#### 215\"}\n{\"question\": \"There were 250 balloons in one package. Dante evenly shared the balloons among his 5 friends. Dante changed his mind and asked each of his friends to give him 11 balloons. How many balloons does each friend have now?\", \"answer\": \"Balloons divided among 5 friends = 250/5 = <<250/5=50>>50 balloons per friend\\nDante took back 11 balloons: 50 - 11 = <<50-11=39>>39 balloons\\nEach friend now has 39 balloons.\\n#### 39\"}\n{\"question\": \"At a birthday party, there are 20 red balloons and 15 green balloons. Before the party started, 3 red and 2 green balloons burst. How many balloons are left?\", \"answer\": \"There are a total of 20 + 15 = <<20+15=35>>35 balloons at the party.\\nOut of the 35, 3 + 2 = 5 balloons burst.\\nThus, only 35 - 5 = <<35-5=30>>30 balloons are left.\\n#### 30\"}"
