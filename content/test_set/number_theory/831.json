    "problem": "Let $S = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \\cdots + 2009 - 2010$. What is the residue of $S$, modulo 2010?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that $x + 2010 \\equiv x \\pmod{2010}$. Add 2010 to every negative summand and rearrange the terms to find $S \\equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 2008 + 2009 \\pmod{2010}$. The right-hand side is the sum of the integers from 1 to 2010, so $S \\equiv \\frac{2010 \\cdot 2011}{2} \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 2011 \\equiv 1005 \\cdot 1 \\equiv \\boxed{1005} \\pmod{2010}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Aubrie has four cards with the labels W, X, Y, Z printed on them. W is tagged with the number 200, X is tagged with half the number W is tagged with, Y is tagged with the total of X and W's tags and Z is tagged with the number 400. Calculate the total of all the tagged numbers.\", \"answer\": \"If the card with the letter X has half the number the card with letter W has, it has 1/2*200= 100\\nTogether, cards with letters W and X have tags that total 100+200 = <<100+200=300>>300.\\nIf the card with the letter Y has the total of the numbers cards with letters, W and X have, then the total for cards with letters W, X, and Y is 300+300 = 600\\nSince the card with the letter Z has a tag of 200, the total of the numbers the tags have is 600+400= 1000\\n#### 1000\"}\n{\"question\": \"James finds 3 bills in his pocket.
