    "problem": "What is the remainder when $9^{1995}$ is divided by 7?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Note that $9^{1995} \\equiv 2^{1995} \\pmod{7}$.  Also, note that $2^3 = 8 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$.  Therefore, \\[2^{1995} = 2^{3 \\cdot 665} = (2^3)^{665} \\equiv \\boxed{1} \\pmod{7}.\\]",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Fifteen more than a quarter of a number is 27. What is the number?\", \"answer\": \"A quarter of the number is 27-15=<<27-15=12>>12.\\nThe number is 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48.\\n#### 48\"}\n{\"question\": \"Jenny had $24 left after spending 3/7 of her money. How much is half of her original amount of money?\", \"answer\": \"Jenny spent 1 - 3/7 = 4/7 of her money.\\nSince 4/7 is equal to $24, then 1/7 is equal to $24/4 = $6.\\nSo, Jenny originally had $6 x 7 = $<<6*7=42>>42.\\nTherefore, half of her original amount of money is $42/2 = $<<42/2=21>>21.\\n#### 21\"}\n{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Darrel has 76 quarters, 85 dimes, 20 nickels and 150 pennies.  If he drops all of his money into a coin-counting machine, they will convert his change into dollars for a 10% fee.  How much will he receive after the 10% fee?\", \"answer\": \"He has 76 quarters so that\\u2019s 76*.25 = $<<76*.25=19.00>>19.00\\nHe has 85 dimes so that\\u2019s 85*.10 = $<<85*.10=8.50>>8.50\\nHe has 20 nickels so that\\u2019s 20*.05 = $<<20*.05=1.00>>1.00\\nHe has 150 pennies so that\\u2019s 150*.01 = $<<150*.01=1.50>>1.50\\nAll total he has 19+8.5+1+1.5 = $<<19+8.5+1+1.5=30.00>>30.00\\nThey charge a 10% fee to count and convert his change into dollars so they will charge him .10*30 = $3.00\\nHe had $30.00 and they charged him $3.00 in fees so he now has 30-3 = $<<30-3=27.00>>27.00\\n#### 27\"}"
