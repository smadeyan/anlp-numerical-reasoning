    "solution": "We are looking for an integer $a$ such that $27a$ is congruent to 1 modulo 28. In other words, we want to solve  \\[\n27 a \\equiv 1 \\pmod{28}.\n\\]We subtract $28a$ from the left-hand side to obtain $-a\\equiv 1 \\pmod{28}$. This congruence is equivalent to the previous one since $28a$ is a multiple of 28. Next we multiply both sides by $-1$ to obtain $a\\equiv -1\\pmod{28}$. Thus $28-1=\\boxed{27}$ is the modular inverse of 27 (mod 28). (Note that since $(m-1)^2=m^2-2m+1\\equiv 1\\pmod{m}$, we always have that $m-1$ is its own inverse modulo $m$.)",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Fifteen more than a quarter of a number is 27. What is the number?\", \"answer\": \"A quarter of the number is 27-15=<<27-15=12>>12.\\nThe number is 12*4=<<12*4=48>>48.\\n#### 48\"}\n{\"question\": \"There are 28 students in a class. Two-sevenths of them were absent last Monday. How many students were present last Monday?\", \"answer\": \"28 x 2/7 = <<28*2/7=8>>8 students were absent last Monday.\\nSo, 28 - 8 = <<28-8=20>>20 students were present last Monday.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"Aubrie has four cards with the labels W, X, Y, Z printed on them. W is tagged with the number 200, X is tagged with half the number W is tagged with, Y is tagged with the total of X and W's tags and Z is tagged with the number 400. Calculate the total of all the tagged numbers.\", \"answer\": \"If the card with the letter X has half the number the card with letter W has, it has 1/2*200= 100\\nTogether, cards with letters W and X have tags that total 100+200 = <<100+200=300>>300.\\nIf the card with the letter Y has the total of the numbers cards with letters, W and X have, then the total for cards with letters W, X, and Y is 300+300 = 600\\nSince the card with the letter Z has a tag of 200, the total of the numbers the tags have is 600+400= 1000\\n#### 1000\"}"
