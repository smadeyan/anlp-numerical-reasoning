    "problem": "What is the least positive integer that is divisible by three distinct primes?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We use the fact that a number which is divisible by three primes must be divisible by their product -- this comes from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Since we are looking for the least positive integer, we look at the three smallest primes: 2, 3, and 5. Multiplying these yields $2 \\times 3 \\times 5 = \\boxed{30}$, which is the least positive integer divisible by three distinct primes.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"There are 3 numbers that are consecutive integers. Together they have a sum of 18. What is the largest of the 3 numbers?\", \"answer\": \"Let N = smallest number\\nN + 1 = next number\\nN + 2 = largest number\\nN + (N + 1) + (N + 2) = 18\\n3N + 3 = 18\\n3N = <<3*5=15>>15\\nN = <<5=5>>5\\nThe largest number is <<7=7>>7.\\n#### 7\"}\n{\"question\": \"The ages of three brothers are consecutive integers with the sum of 96.  How old is the youngest brother?\", \"answer\": \"Let x represent the youngest brother\\nMiddle brother:x+1\\nOldest brother:x+2\\nTotal:x+x+1+x+2=96\\n3x+3=96\\n3x=93\\nx=<<31=31>>31 years old\\n#### 31\"}\n{\"question\": \"There are 3 consecutive odd integers that have a sum of -147.

His dad tells him that the number, when multiplied by 3, is three less than twice 51. What is the number?\", \"answer\": \"102 is twice 51 because 2 x 51 = <<2*51=102>>102\\nThree less than 102 is 99 because 102 -3 = <<102-3=99>>99\\nThe number is 33 because 99 / 3 = <<99/3=33>>33\\n#### 33\"}"
