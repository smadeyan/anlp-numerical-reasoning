    "problem": "The numbers 60, 221, and 229 are the legs and hypotenuse of a right triangle.  Find the multiplicative inverse to 450 modulo 3599.  (Express your answer as an integer $n$ with $0\\leq n<3599$.)",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "We notice that $450=221+229,$ so that must be the connection.  The Pythagorean Theorem tells us  \\[60^2+221^2=229^2\\] so \\[229^2-221^2=60^2.\\] The difference of squares factorization tells us  \\[(229-221)(229+221)=3600\\] and taken modulo 3599 we get  \\[8\\cdot450\\equiv1\\pmod{3599}.\\] The answer is $\\boxed{8}$.",

It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"The three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  The largest angle is 5 times bigger than the smallest. The middle angle is 3 times bigger than the smallest. How many degrees is the smallest angle?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the smallest angle.\\nThe combination of the three is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.\\nThus 9x = 180.\\nSo x = <<20=20>>20.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"The sum of the three sides of a triangle is 50.
