    "problem": "What integer $n$ satisfies $0\\le n<19$ and $$-200\\equiv n\\pmod{19}~?$$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Number Theory",
    "solution": "Noticing that $190\\equiv0\\pmod{19}$ and $-200+190=-10$, we can say that  \\[-200\\equiv n\\pmod{19}\\]if and only if  \\[-10\\equiv n\\pmod{19}.\\]This is not in the range $0\\leq n<19$, but adding 19 again gives \\[9\\equiv n\\pmod{19}.\\]The answer is $n=\\boxed{9}$.",

The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number.
