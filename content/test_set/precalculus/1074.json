    "solution": "Note that the magnitude of the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2}$ is 3.  Furthermore, if this vector makes an angle of $\\theta$ with the positive $x$-axis, then\n\\[\\cos \\theta = \\frac{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}}{\\left\\| \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\| \\left\\|\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right\\|} = \\frac{1}{3}.\\]This tells us that $\\theta$ is acute, so the vector passes through the positive $x$-axis at $(3,0,0).$\n\n[asy]\nimport three;\n\nsize(180);\ncurrentprojection = perspective(3,4,2);\n\ntriple I = (1,0,0), J = (0,1,0), K = (0,0,1), O = (0,0,0);\ntriple A = (1,2,2), B = (4/sqrt(2),-1/sqrt(2),-1/sqrt(2));\n\ndraw(O--3*I, Arrow3(6));\ndraw(O--3*J, Arrow3(6));\ndraw(O--3*K, Arrow3(6));\ndraw(O--A,red,Arrow3(6));\ndraw(O--B,blue,Arrow3(6));\ndraw(A..(A + B)/sqrt(2)..B,dashed);\n\nlabel(\"$x$\", 3.2*I);\nlabel(\"$y$\", 3.2*J);\nlabel(\"$z$\", 3.2*K);\n[/asy]\n\nLet the resulting vector be $(x,y,z).$  By symmetry, $y = z.$  Also, since the magnitude of the vector is preserved,\n\\[x^2 + 2y^2 = 9.\\]Also, since the vector is rotated by $90^\\circ,$ the resulting vector is orthogonal to the original vector.  Thus,\n\\[\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = 0,\\]which gives us $x + 4y = 0.$  Then $x = -4y.$  Substituting into $x^2 + 2y^2 = 9,$ we get\n\\[16y^2 + 2y^2 = 9,\\]so $y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}.$  Hence, $y = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$ so $x = -4y = \\mp 2 \\sqrt{2}.$  From the geometry of the diagram, $x$ is positive and $y$ and $z$ are negative, so $x = 2 \\sqrt{2}.$  Then $y = z = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},$ so the resulting vector is\n\\[\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\sqrt{2} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\end{pmatrix}}.\\]",
