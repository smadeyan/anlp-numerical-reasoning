    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Tod drives his family car 55 miles to the north and 95 miles to the west. If Tod constantly drives 25 miles an hour the entire trip how many hours did Tod drive?\", \"answer\": \"55 miles north and 95 miles west give 55+95=<<55+95=150>>150 miles total\\n150 miles at 25 miles an hour gives 150/25=<<150/25=6>>6 hours\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"The journey from Abel's house to Alice's house is 35 miles and is divided into 5 equal portions. Abel is driving at a speed of 40 miles per hour. After traveling for 0.7 hours, how many portions of the journey has he covered?\", \"answer\": \"35 miles into 5 equal portions will be 35/5 = <<35/5=7>>7 miles each\\nAbel traveled at a speed of 40 miles per hour for 0.7 hours so he will cover 40*0.7 = <<40*0.7=28>>28 miles\\n7 miles make a portion so 28 miles is equivalent to 28/7 = <<28/7=4>>4 portions\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Luis is driving 80 miles in 2 hours. How far will he go in 15 minutes?\", \"answer\": \"Luis drives 80/2 = <<80/2=40>>40 miles in 1 hour.\\nSince there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, then he drives 40/60 = 2/3 of a mile in 1 minute.\\nSo in 15 minutes, he will go 2/3 x 15 = <<2/3*15=10>>10 miles far.\\n#### 10\"}\n{\"question\": \"Greg drives 30 miles from his workplace to the farmer's market. After buying his groceries at the farmers market, he drives home. To get home, he travels for 30 minutes at 20 miles per hour. How many miles in total does Greg travel?\", \"answer\": \"We must first convert minutes to hours, so 30 minutes * (1 hour/60 minutes) = <<30*(1/60)=0.5>>0.5 hours\\nThe number of miles Greg travels on his trip home is 0.5 hours * 20 mph = <<0.5*20=10>>10 miles\\nThe total miles Greg travels is 10 + 30 = <<10+30=40>>40 miles\\n#### 40\"}"
