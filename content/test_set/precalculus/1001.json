Each of the roads has 250 street lights on each opposite side. Calculate the total number of street lights on all the roads of the neighborhoods in the town.\", \"answer\": \"If Each of the roads has 250 street lights on each opposite side, the total number of street lights on one road is 250*2 = <<250*2=500>>500\\nSince each neighborhood has four roads passing through it, the total number of street lights in one neighborhood is 500*4 = <<500*4=2000>>2000 street lights.\\nThe town has ten neighborhoods, and since each neighborhood has 2000 street lights on all its roads, there are 2000*10 = <<2000*10=20000>>20000 street lights in the town.\\n#### 20000\"}\n{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates.
