    "problem": "A bee starts flying from point $P_0$. She flies $1$ inch due east to point $P_1$. For $j \\ge 1$, once the bee reaches point $P_j$, she turns $30^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise and then flies $j+1$ inches straight to point $P_{j+1}$. When the bee reaches $P_{2015},$ how far from $P_0$ is she, in inches?",
