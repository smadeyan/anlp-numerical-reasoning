He decides to put 30 more pairs of plugs into the box of plugs. If the box of mittens has 150 pairs of mittens, how many plugs are there?\", \"answer\": \"Since there are 20 fewer mittens pairs than the plugs, there are 150+20 = 170 pairs of plugs.\\nWhen Gunner decides to add 30 more plugs pairs into the box of plugs, the number of plug pairs increases to 170+30 = <<170+30=200>>200\\nSince a pair has two, the 200 pairs of plugs total 200*2 = <<200*2=400>>400 plugs.\\n#### 400\"}\n{\"question\": \"A jar contains 9 blue pens, 21 black pens, and 6 red pens.

She walks 3 blocks north, then seven times as many blocks west. Then she turns around and walks 8 blocks south and twice as many blocks east in the direction of her home. If Janet can walk 2 blocks/minute, how long will it take her to get home?\", \"answer\": \"First, find the total number of blocks south Janet is from her starting point by subtracting the blocks she walked north from the blocks she walked south: 8 blocks - 3 blocks = <<8-3=5>>5 blocks\\nThen find the number blocks she walked west: 3 blocks * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 blocks\\nThen find the number of blocks she walked east: 8 blocks * 2 = <<8*2=16>>16 blocks\\nSubtract the number of blocks she walked east from the number of blocks she walked west to find how many blocks west of her starting point she is: 21 blocks - 16 blocks = <<21-16=5>>5 blocks\\nAdd the number of blocks she needs to walk north to the number of blocks she needs to walk east: 5 blocks + 5 blocks = <<5+5=10>>10 blocks\\nFinally, divide the distance she needs to walk by her speed to find how long she'll spend walking: 10 blocks / 2 blocks/minute = <<10/2=5>>5 minutes\\n#### 5\"}"
