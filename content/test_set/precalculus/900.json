    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Annie is building a diorama for her history class. The amount of time she spent building it is equal to three times the amount of time she spent planning it minus 5 minutes. If she spent 67 minutes on the diorama total, how many minutes did she spend building it?\", \"answer\": \"Let p be the planning time in minutes and b be the building time. We know that b = 3p - 5 and b + p = 67\\nSubstituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 3p - 5 + p = 67\\nCombining like terms, we get 4p - 5 = 67\\nAdding 5 to both sides, we get 4p = 72\\nDividing both sides by 4, we get p = 18\\nSubstituting this value into b = 3p - 5, we find that b = 3 * 18 - 5 = <<3*18-5=49>>49\\n#### 49\"}\n{\"question\": \"In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates. If there are 45 pirates, how many noodles and pirates are there in total?\", \"answer\": \"In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45-7=<<45-7=38>>38 noodles.\\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 38+45=<<38+45=83>>83\\n#### 83\"}\n{\"question\": \"The area of a forest is three times the area of the square-shaped street. If the street has a length of 100 meters on one side and the number of trees per square meter in the forest is 4, calculate the total number of trees in the forest.\", \"answer\": \"Since the area of a square is sides squared, the area of the square-shaped street is 100*100 = <<100*100=10000>>10000 square meters.\\nThe area of the forest is three times the area of the square-shaped street, a total of 3*10000 = <<3*10000=30000>>30000 square meters.\\nIf the number of trees per square meter in the forest is 4, there are 4*30000 = <<4*30000=120000>>120000 trees in the forest.\\n#### 120000\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}"
