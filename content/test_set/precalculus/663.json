    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"In a single day, it rained for many hours. From 2pm to 4pm, it rained at a rate of 4 inches per hour.  From 4pm to 7pm, it rained at a rate of 3 inches per hour.  And from 7pm to 9pm, it rained at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour.  If the rain gauge started out the day already containing 2 inches of rainwater, how many inches of water will the gauge contain at 9pm?\", \"answer\": \"From 2pm to 4pm is 4-2=2 hours.\\nThus, from 2-4pm, raining at 4 inches per hour, it added 8 inches to the rain gauge.\\nFrom 4pm to 7pm is 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 hours.\\nThus, from 4-7pm, raining at a rate of 3 inches per hour, it added 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 inches to the rain gauge.\\nFrom 7pm to 9pm is 9-7=<<9-7=2>>2 hours.\\nThus, from 7-9pm, raining at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour, it added 2*0.5=1 inch to the gauge.\\nIf the gauge originally contained 2 inches of water, by 9pm the gauge contained 2+8+9+1=<<2+8+9+1=20>>20 inches of water.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"In 2 years, Maxwell will be twice his sister's age. If his sister is now 2, how old is Maxwell now?\", \"answer\": \"In two years, Maxwell's sister will be 2 years + 2 years = <<2+2=4>>4 years old.\\nTherefore, Maxwell will be 4 years x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 years old in two years.\\nMaxwell is now 8 years - 2 years = <<8-2=6>>6 years old.\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"Manny has a tree that grows at the rate of fifty centimeters every two weeks. If the tree is currently 2 meters tall, how tall, in centimeters, will the tree be in 4 months?\", \"answer\": \"A month has four weeks, so there are 4*4= <<4*4=16>>16 weeks in four months.\\nSince the tree grows for five centimeters every two weeks, it will grow by fifty centimeters every week for 16/2 = 8 weeks.\\nThe tree will increase in height by 8*50 = <<8*50=400>>400 centimeters after four months.\\nSince 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, the tree is currently 2*100 = <<2*100=200>>200 centimeters tall.\\nAfter growing by 400 centimeters for four months, the tree will be 400+200 = <<400+200=600>>600 centimeters tall.\\n#### 600\"}\n{\"question\": \"A special balloon increases by two-fifths of its previous volume every hour when placed under water.
