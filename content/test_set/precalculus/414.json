    "problem": "The curve parameterized by $(x,y) = (2t + 4, 4t - 5)$ is a line, where $t$ is a real number.  Find the equation of the line.  Enter the equation in the form \"$y = mx + b$\".",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Precalculus",
    "solution": "Solving for $t$ in $x = 2t + 4,$ we find\n\\[t = \\frac{x - 4}{2}.\\]Then\n\\[y = 4t - 5 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{x - 4}{2} - 5 = 2x - 13.\\]Thus, the equation is $\\boxed{y = 2x - 13}.$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Emily went to the store and bought art supplies for $20 and 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money. She spent a total of $50. How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\", \"answer\": \"First, you need to set up the problem with the information given. The cost of the skirts and art supplies must equal $<<50=50>>50.\\nSince we know that the cost of the skirts is the same price and that she bought art supplies for $20, we can set up an equation: 2x + 20 = 50, with x being the cost of the skirts.\\nTo solve the equation, subtract 20 from both sides, to give you the new equation: 2x = 30.\\nSolve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, 2x/2 = 30/2 gives you x = 15.\\nTherefore, each skirt cost $<<15=15>>15.\\n#### 15\"}\n{\"question\": \"John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\", \"answer\": \"He travels 1450-100=<<1450-100=1350>>1350 feet vertically\\nSo he travels 1350*2=<<1350*2=2700>>2700 feet horizontally\\n#### 2700\"}\n{\"question\": \"Carla's brush is 12 inches long. If Carmen's brush is 50% longer than Carla's brush, how long is Carmen's brush in centimeters? (There are 2.5 centimeters per inch.)\", \"answer\": \"First find the length of Carmen's brush in inches: 150% * 12 inches = <<150*.01*12=18>>18 inches\\nThen convert the length from inches to centimeters: 18 inches * 2.5 centimeters/inch = <<18*2.5=45>>45 centimeters\\n#### 45\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}"
