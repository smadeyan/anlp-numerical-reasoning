    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates. If there are 45 pirates, how many noodles and pirates are there in total?\", \"answer\": \"In the matrix, there are seven fewer noodles than pirates, meaning there are 45-7=<<45-7=38>>38 noodles.\\nThe number of noodles and pirates in the matrix is 38+45=<<38+45=83>>83\\n#### 83\"}\n{\"question\": \"Ali, Nada, and John have a total of $67 in their wallets. Ali has $5 less than Nada and John has 4 times more than Nada. How much money does John have?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say that N is what Nada has, J is what John has, and A is what Ali has. We know that A = N - 5 and J = 4N.\\nWe also know that: N + A + J = $67\\nWe can substitute the equations from step 1 into the equations from step 2 to get: N + 4N + (N-5) = $67\\nCombining like terms gets us 6N - 5 = $67\\nSo, N=($67+5)/6 = $12\\nSubstituting $12 back into the equation J = 4 N, we find John has 4 x 12 = $<<4*12=48>>48\\n#### 48\"}"
