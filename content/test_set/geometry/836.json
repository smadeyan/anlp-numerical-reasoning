The radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{64} = 8$, so the circle has area $8^2\\pi = 64\\pi$. Therefore, the desired area is $64\\pi\\cdot\\frac{3}{8}=\\boxed{24 \\pi}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"If a circle has a radius of 14 feet, how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle?\", \"answer\": \"A circle with a radius of 14 feet has a diameter of 2*14=<<14*2=28>>28 feet.\\nA six-inch pencil is 6/12=<<6/12=0.5>>0.5 feet long.\\nThus, across a 28-foot diameter, one can place 28/0.5=<<28/0.5=56>>56 6-inch pencils.\\n#### 56\"}\n{\"question\": \"There is a rectangle that is 4 inches wide.
