    "solution": "The x and y axis of this graph break it down into four triangles each with the same area. We find that the x and y intercepts of this graph are $(0,5)$, $(0,-5)$, $(10,0)$, and $(-10,0)$. This means that the area of each triangle is $$\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot5\\cdot10=25.$$ Therefore, the total area is $4\\cdot25=\\boxed{100}$ square units.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"You draw a rectangle that is 7 inches wide. It is 4 times as long as it is wide. What is the area of the rectangle?\", \"answer\": \"The length of the rectangle is 4 * 7 inches = <<4*7=28>>28 inches.\\nThe area of the rectangle is 7 inches * 28 inches = <<7*28=196>>196 square inches.\\n#### 196\"}\n{\"question\": \"There is a rectangle that is 4 inches wide. If the rectangle's perimeter is 30 inches, what is the area of the rectangle?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the height of the rectangle is 30 inches - 2 * 4 inches = <<30-2*4=22>>22 inches.\\nThe rectangle's height is 22 inches / 2 = <<22/2=11>>11 inches.\\nThe area of the rectangle is 4 inches * 11 inches = <<4*11=44>>44 square inches.\\n#### 44\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangle has a length of 40 meters and a width of 20 meters. A similar smaller rectangle has half the length and width of the big rectangle. What's the area of the smaller rectangle?\", \"answer\": \"The length of the smaller rectangle is 1/2*40 = <<1/2*40=20>>20 meters.\\nThe width of the smaller rectangle is 1/2*20 = <<1/2*20=10>>10 meters.\\nSince the area of a rectangle is found by multiplying the length times the width, the total area of the smaller rectangle is 20*10 = <<20*10=200>>200 meters square.\\n#### 200\"}"
