If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?\", \"answer\": \"A triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2 square inches because (1/2) x 2 x 2 = <<(1/2)*2*2=2>>2\\nThe square has an area of 4 square inches because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4\\n2 triangles would fit because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2\\n#### 2\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"Bailey is making a rectangle out of a 100cm length of rope he has. If the longer sides of the rectangle were 28cm long, what is the length of each of the shorter sides?\", \"answer\": \"The longer sides are 2 in number so their total length of 2*28cm = <<2*28=56>>56cm\\nThe rest of the length making up the short sides is 100-56 = <<100-56=44>>44 cm\\nThere are two equal short sides so each one is 44/2 = <<44/2=22>>22cm\\n#### 22\"}"
