    "problem": "Triangle $ABC$ has positive integer side lengths with $AB=AC$. Let $I$ be the intersection of the bisectors of $\\angle B$ and $\\angle C$. Suppose $BI=8$. Find the smallest possible perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$.\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Let $D$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. Then by SAS Congruence, $\\triangle ABD \\cong \\triangle ACD$, so $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADC = 90^o$.\nNow let $BD=y$, $AB=x$, and $\\angle IBD = \\dfrac{\\angle ABD}{2} = \\theta$.\nThen $\\mathrm{cos}{(\\theta)} = \\dfrac{y}{8}$\nand $\\mathrm{cos}{(2\\theta)} = \\dfrac{y}{x} = 2\\mathrm{cos^2}{(\\theta)} - 1 = \\dfrac{y^2-32}{32}$.\nCross-multiplying yields $32y = x(y^2-32)$.\nSince $x,y>0$, $y^2-32$ must be positive, so $y > 5.5$.\nAdditionally, since $\\triangle IBD$ has hypotenuse $\\overline{IB}$ of length $8$, $BD=y < 8$.\nTherefore, given that $BC=2y$ is an integer, the only possible values for $y$ are $6$, $6.5$, $7$, and $7.5$.\nHowever, only one of these values, $y=6$, yields an integral value for $AB=x$, so we conclude that $y=6$ and $x=\\dfrac{32(6)}{(6)^2-32}=48$.\nThus the perimeter of $\\triangle ABC$ must be $2(x+y) = \\boxed{108}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\", \"answer\": \"To get the perimeter, you add all the sides o the triangles, so the first two sides add up to 40+50 = <<40+50=90>>90 cm.\\nIf the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160-90 = <<160-90=70>>70 cm.\\n#### 70\"}\n{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"The three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  The largest angle is 5 times bigger than the smallest. The middle angle is 3 times bigger than the smallest. How many degrees is the smallest angle?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the smallest angle.\\nThe combination of the three is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.\\nThus 9x = 180.\\nSo x = <<20=20>>20.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"The area of a triangle with a given base and height is given by 1/2*base*height.
