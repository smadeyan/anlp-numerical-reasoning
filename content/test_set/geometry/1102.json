    "solution": "We have $\\angle B = \\angle PTQ$ and $\\angle TPQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle QPA - \\angle APB = 90^\\circ - \\angle APB = \\angle BAP$.  Therefore, $\\triangle BAP \\sim \\triangle TPQ$.  Since $AB/AP = 4/5$, triangles $BAP$ and $PTQ$ are $\\{3,4,5\\}$ right triangles, and we have $TQ = \\frac35(15) = 9$ and $TP = \\frac45(15)=12$.  Since $ABCD$ is a rectangle and $TS$ is perpendicular to $BC$, then $ABTS$ is also a rectangle. Thus, $TS=BA=16$ and $QS=TS-QT=16-9=7$.\n\nIn triangles $PQT$ and $DQS$, $\\angle PTQ=\\angle DSQ=90^{\\circ}$. Also, $\\angle PQT$ and $\\angle DQS$ are vertically opposite angles and are therefore equal. Therefore, $\\triangle PQT$ and $\\triangle DQS$ are similar triangles. Since $\\triangle PQT$ and $\\triangle DQS$ are similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding side lengths in these two triangles are equal.\n\nThat is, $\\dfrac{SD}{TP}=\\dfrac{QS}{QT}$ or $\\dfrac{SD}{12}=\\dfrac{7}{9}$ or $SD=12\\times\\dfrac{7}{9}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{28}{3}}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"Bailey is making a rectangle out of a 100cm length of rope he has. If the longer sides of the rectangle were 28cm long, what is the length of each of the shorter sides?\", \"answer\": \"The longer sides are 2 in number so their total length of 2*28cm = <<2*28=56>>56cm\\nThe rest of the length making up the short sides is 100-56 = <<100-56=44>>44 cm\\nThere are two equal short sides so each one is 44/2 = <<44/2=22>>22cm\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}"
