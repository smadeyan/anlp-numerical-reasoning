    "problem": "The numbers $\\sqrt{2u-1}$, $\\sqrt{2u+1}$ and $2\\sqrt{u}$ are the side lengths of a triangle. How many degrees are in the measure of the largest angle?",
    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Geometry",
    "solution": "Square each side length to obtain $2u-1$, $2u+1$, and $4u$.  Notice that the first two expressions, $2u-1$, $2u+1$, sum to give the third.  Therefore, the sides of the triangle satisfy the Pythagorean theorem, and the triangle is a right triangle. The measure of the largest angle in a right triangle is $\\boxed{90}$ degrees.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"The three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  The largest angle is 5 times bigger than the smallest. The middle angle is 3 times bigger than the smallest. How many degrees is the smallest angle?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the smallest angle.\\nThe combination of the three is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.\\nThus 9x = 180.\\nSo x = <<20=20>>20.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"The sum of the three angles of a triangle equals 250. The left angle is twice the right angle's value, and the right angle is 60 degrees. Find the value of the top angle?\", \"answer\": \"Since the left angle is twice the value of the right angle, the left angle is 60*2 = <<60*2=120>>120 degrees.\\nThe total value of the left and right angles is 120+60 = <<120+60=180>>180 degrees.\\nSince the sum of the three angles is equal to 250, the other angle has a value of 250-180 = <<250-180=70>>70 degrees.\\n#### 70\"}\n{\"question\": \"In a triangle with angles A, B, and C, A is 60 degrees, and B is two times as big as C. Calculate the angle of B.\", \"answer\": \"Since the angles in a triangle adds up to 180, and A is 40 degrees, B and C have a total of 180-60 = <<180-60=120>>120 degrees.\\nSince B is two times bigger than C, the total of the angles of B and C is equal to 2C+C = 120\\n3C=120\\nThe angle of C is C=120/3\\nC is <<40=40>>40\\nSince B is two times as big as C, B is 2*40 = 80 degrees.\\n#### 80\"}\n{\"question\": \"The sum of the three sides of a triangle is 50. The right side of the triangle is 2 cm longer than the left side. Find the value of the triangle base if the left side has a value of 12 cm.\", \"answer\": \"If the left side of the triangle is 12, and the right side is 2 cm longer, the right side is 12+2 = <<12+2=14>>14 cm long.\\nThe sum of the left and right sides of the triangle is 14+12 = <<14+12=26>>26 cm.\\nIf the sum of all sides of the is 50, and the left and right sides of the triangle are 26, the triangle base is 50-26 = <<50-26=24>>24 cm.\\n#### 24\"}"
