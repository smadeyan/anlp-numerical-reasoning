    "solution": "Rotating $360^\\circ$ is the same as doing nothing, so rotating $510^\\circ$ is the same as rotating $510^\\circ - 360^\\circ = 150^\\circ$.  Therefore, we have $\\sin 510^\\circ = \\sin (510^\\circ - 360^\\circ) = \\sin 150^\\circ$.\n\nLet $P$ be the point on the unit circle that is $150^\\circ$ counterclockwise from $(1,0)$, and let $D$ be the foot of the altitude from $P$ to the $x$-axis, as shown below.\n\n[asy]\npair A,C,P,O,D;\ndraw((0,-1.2)--(0,1.2),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));\ndraw((-1.2,0)--(1.2,0),p=black+1.2bp,Arrows(0.15cm));\nA = (1,0);\nO= (0,0);\nlabel(\"$x$\",(1.2,0),SE);\nlabel(\"$y$\",(0,1.2),NE);\n\nP = rotate(150)*A;\nD = foot(P,A,-A);\ndraw(O--P--D);\ndraw(rightanglemark(O,D,P,2));\ndraw(Circle(O,1));\nlabel(\"$O$\",O,SE);\nlabel(\"$P$\",P,NW);\n//label(\"$A$\",A,SE);\nlabel(\"$D$\",D,S);\n[/asy]\n\nTriangle $POD$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, so $DO = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $DP = \\frac12$.  Therefore, the coordinates of $P$ are $\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac12\\right)$, so $\\sin 510^\\circ = \\sin 150^\\circ = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$.",

The first bell takes 50 pounds of bronze, the second bell is twice the size of the first bell, and the third bell is four times the size of the second bell. How much bronze does he need total?\", \"answer\": \"First find the size of the second bell: 50 pounds * 2 = <<50*2=100>>100 pounds\\nThen find the size of the third bell: 100 pounds * 4 = <<100*4=400>>400 pounds\\nThen add the amount of bronze used for each bell to find the total: 100 pounds + 400 pounds + 50 pounds = <<100+400+50=550>>550 pounds\\n#### 550\"}\n{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"Four small boxes can fit in one big box. If 50 big boxes can fit four small boxes each, each having 40 candles, calculate the total number of candles in all small boxes.\", \"answer\": \"If 50 big boxes are fit 4 small boxes each, the number of small boxes is 4*50 = <<50*4=200>>200\\nSince the small boxes have 40 candles each, there are 40*200 = <<40*200=8000>>8000 candles in total.\\n#### 8000\"}\n{\"question\": \"The sum of the three sides of a triangle is 50.
