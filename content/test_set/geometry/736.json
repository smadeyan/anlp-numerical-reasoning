    "solution": "Because $\\triangle JKL$ is a right triangle, $\\tan K = \\frac{JL}{JK}$. So $\\tan K = \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{JL}{2}$. Then $JL = 3$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean Theorem, $KL = \\sqrt{JL^2 + JK^2} = \\sqrt{3^2 + 2^2} = \\boxed{\\sqrt{13}}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"The sum of the three sides of a triangle is 50. The right side of the triangle is 2 cm longer than the left side. Find the value of the triangle base if the left side has a value of 12 cm.\", \"answer\": \"If the left side of the triangle is 12, and the right side is 2 cm longer, the right side is 12+2 = <<12+2=14>>14 cm long.\\nThe sum of the left and right sides of the triangle is 14+12 = <<14+12=26>>26 cm.\\nIf the sum of all sides of the is 50, and the left and right sides of the triangle are 26, the triangle base is 50-26 = <<50-26=24>>24 cm.\\n#### 24\"}\n{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"The three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  The largest angle is 5 times bigger than the smallest. The middle angle is 3 times bigger than the smallest. How many degrees is the smallest angle?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the smallest angle.\\nThe combination of the three is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.\\nThus 9x = 180.\\nSo x = <<20=20>>20.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"The area of a triangle with a given base and height is given by 1/2*base*height. What is the base length of a triangle with height 8 and area 24 square units?\", \"answer\": \"Let b be the base of the triangle\\n(1/2)*b*8=24.\\n4*b=24\\nb=<<6=6>>6\\n#### 6\"}"
