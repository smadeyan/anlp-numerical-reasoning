    "solution": "Let $a$ denote the length of a diagonal opposite adjacent sides of length $14$ and $3$, $b$ for sides $14$ and $10$, and $c$ for sides $3$ and $10$. Using Ptolemy's Theorem on the five possible quadrilaterals in the configuration, we obtain:\n\\begin{align} c^2 &= 3a+100 \\\\ c^2 &= 10b+9 \\\\ ab &= 30+14c \\\\ ac &= 3c+140\\\\ bc &= 10c+42 \\end{align}\nUsing equations $(1)$ and $(2)$, we obtain:\n\\[a = \\frac{c^2-100}{3}\\]\nand\n\\[b = \\frac{c^2-9}{10}\\]\nPlugging into equation $(4)$, we find that:\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{c^2-100}{3}c &= 3c + 140\\\\ \\frac{c^3-100c}{3} &= 3c + 140\\\\ c^3-100c &= 9c + 420\\\\ c^3-109c-420 &=0\\\\ (c-12)(c+7)(c+5)&=0 \\end{align*}\nOr similarly into equation $(5)$ to check:\n\\begin{align*} \\frac{c^2-9}{10}c &= 10c+42\\\\ \\frac{c^3-9c}{10} &= 10c + 42\\\\ c^3-9c &= 100c + 420\\\\ c^3-109c-420 &=0\\\\ (c-12)(c+7)(c+5)&=0 \\end{align*}\n$c$, being a length, must be positive, implying that $c=12$. In fact, this is reasonable, since $10+3\\approx 12$ in the pentagon with apparently obtuse angles. Plugging this back into equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ we find that $a = \\frac{44}{3}$ and $b= \\frac{135}{10}=\\frac{27}{2}$.\nWe desire $3c+a+b = 3\\cdot 12 + \\frac{44}{3} + \\frac{27}{2} = \\frac{216+88+81}{6}=\\frac{385}{6}$, so it follows that the answer is $385 + 6 = \\boxed{391}$",

What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"Isaac cut his 30 meters ribbon into 6 equal parts. He then used 4 parts of the ribbon.
