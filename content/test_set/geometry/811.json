    "solution": "Since $RPS$ is a straight line, then $\\angle SPQ = 180^\\circ - \\angle RPQ = 180^\\circ - 3y^\\circ$.\n\nUsing the angles in $\\triangle PQS$, we have $\\angle PQS + \\angle QSP + \\angle SPQ = 180^\\circ$. Thus, $x^\\circ+2y^\\circ + (180^\\circ - 3y^\\circ) = 180^\\circ$ or $x-y+180 = 180$ or $x=y$.\n\n(We could have instead looked at $\\angle RPQ$ as being an external angle to $\\triangle SPQ$.)\n\nSince $x=y$, then $\\angle RQS=2y^\\circ$.\n\nSince $RP=PQ$, then $\\angle PRQ=\\angle PQR=x^\\circ = y^\\circ$.

If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide.
