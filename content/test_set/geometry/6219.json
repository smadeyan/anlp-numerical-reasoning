    "solution": "One of the most common formulas involving the inradius of a triangle is $A = rs$, where $A$ is the area of the triangle, $r$ is the inradius, and $s$ is the semiperimeter.\nThe problem states that $A = p = 2s$. This means $2s = rs$, or $r = \\boxed{2}$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"The perimeter of a triangle is 160 cm. If two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm, calculate the length of the third side?\", \"answer\": \"To get the perimeter, you add all the sides o the triangles, so the first two sides add up to 40+50 = <<40+50=90>>90 cm.\\nIf the perimeter of the triangle is 160, the remaining side is 160-90 = <<160-90=70>>70 cm.\\n#### 70\"}\n{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}\n{\"question\": \"If a circle has a radius of 14 feet, how many 6-inch pencils can be placed end-to-end across the diameter of the circle?\", \"answer\": \"A circle with a radius of 14 feet has a diameter of 2*14=<<14*2=28>>28 feet.\\nA six-inch pencil is 6/12=<<6/12=0.5>>0.5 feet long.\\nThus, across a 28-foot diameter, one can place 28/0.5=<<28/0.5=56>>56 6-inch pencils.\\n#### 56\"}"
