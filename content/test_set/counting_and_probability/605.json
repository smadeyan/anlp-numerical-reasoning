    "problem": "How many natural-number factors does $N$ have if $N = 2^4 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2$?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Any positive integer divisor of $N$ must take the form $2^a \\cdot 3^b \\cdot 5^c \\cdot 7^d$ where $0 \\leq a \\leq 4$, $0 \\leq b \\le 3$, $0 \\le c \\le 2$, $0\\leq d \\leq 2$. In other words, there are 5 choices for $a$, 4 choices for $b$, 3 choices for $c$, and 3 choices for $d$. So there are $5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3= \\boxed{180}$ natural-number factors of $N$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"There are 3 numbers that are consecutive integers. Together they have a sum of 18. What is the largest of the 3 numbers?\", \"answer\": \"Let N = smallest number\\nN + 1 = next number\\nN + 2 = largest number\\nN + (N + 1) + (N + 2) = 18\\n3N + 3 = 18\\n3N = <<3*5=15>>15\\nN = <<5=5>>5\\nThe largest number is <<7=7>>7.\\n#### 7\"}\n{\"question\": \"A jar full of marbles is sitting on a table. Half of the marbles are blue, a quarter of them are red, 27 of them are green, and 14 of them are yellow. How many marbles are in the jar?\", \"answer\": \"Let x = the number of marbles in the jar.\\nIf 50% of the marbles are blue, and 25% of them are red, then the remaining 25% must be either green or yellow.\\nSo 0.25 * x = 27 green marbles + 14 yellow marbles = 41 marbles.\\nSo there are a total of 4 * 41 = <<4*41=164>>164 marbles in the jar.\\n#### 164\"}"
