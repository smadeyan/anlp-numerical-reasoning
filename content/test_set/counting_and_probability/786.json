    "problem": "Two standard 6-sided dice are rolled.  What is the probability that the sum rolled is a perfect square?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Rolling two dice has $6 \\times 6=36$ possible outcomes.  The only perfect squares that we can roll are 4 and 9. Pairs adding up to 4 are 1+3, 2+2, and 3+1. Those that add up to 9 are 3+6, 4+5, 5+4, and 6+3. The answer is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{36}}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Tom and Tim both brought 4, six-sided dice to school. How many total sides are there?\", \"answer\": \"There are 8 total dice because 4 plus 4 equals 8\\nThere are 48 sides because 8 times six equals <<8*6=48>>48\\n#### 48\"}\n{\"question\": \"Ivan has 20 dice. Jerry has twice as many dice as Ivan. How many dice do they have altogether?\", \"answer\": \"Jerry has 2 x 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 dice.\\nTherefore, they have 20 + 40 = <<20+40=60>>60 dice altogether.\\n#### 60\"}\n{\"question\": \"Yuko likes to play board games. He decides to play a game with his brother Yuri. They must roll 3 dice at the same time and move the squares corresponding to the value of the 3 dice. Yuri started and his dice had the following combination: 2, 4, and 5. On Yuko's turn, he rolled 1, 5, and X. How many squares must Yuko's last die move him so that he is in front of his brother?\", \"answer\": \"The sum of Yuri's dice gave, 2 + 4 + 5 = <<2+4+5=11>>11 squares.\\nFor Yuko to get the same sum in the dice, 1 + 5 + X = 11 squares.\\nSolving the equation, X = 11 - 6, X = <<11-6=5>>5 squares.\\nTo stand in front of his brother, Yuko needs to be at least 1 place in front, so his last die will move him, 5 + 1 = <<5+1=6>>6 squares.\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"Ronald is rolling a die and won't stop rolling until the average of all his rolls is a 3. He rolls a 1, a 3, a 2, a 4, a 3, a 5, a 3, a 4, a 4 and a 2. What does he need to roll on the next roll to be able to stop?\", \"answer\": \"The next roll will be his 11th roll.\\nThe total on this tenth roll to have an average of 3 is 33, because 3 * 11 = <<33=33>>33\\nHis current total is 31 because 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 2= <<1+3+2+4+3+5+6+1+4+2=31>>31\\nHe needs to roll a 2 because 33 - 31 = <<33-31=2>>2\\n#### 2\"}"
