    "problem": "Dave arrives at an airport which has twelve gates arranged in a straight line with exactly $100$ feet between adjacent gates. His departure gate is assigned at random. After waiting at that gate, Dave is told the departure gate has been changed to a different gate, again at random. Let the probability that Dave walks $400$ feet or less to the new gate be a fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$.\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $12 \\cdot 11 = 132$ possible situations ($12$ choices for the initially assigned gate, and $11$ choices for which gate Dave's flight was changed to). We are to count the situations in which the two gates are at most $400$ feet apart.\nIf we number the gates $1$ through $12$, then gates $1$ and $12$ have four other gates within $400$ feet, gates $2$ and $11$ have five, gates $3$ and $10$ have six, gates $4$ and $9$ have have seven, and gates $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$ have eight. Therefore, the number of valid gate assignments is\\[2\\cdot(4+5+6+7)+4\\cdot8 = 2 \\cdot 22 + 4 \\cdot 8 = 76\\]so the probability is $\\frac{76}{132} = \\frac{19}{33}$. The answer is $19 + 33 = \\boxed{52}$.",

He's supposed to patrol the outside of a warehouse that's 600 feet long and 400 feet wide. If Carson is supposed to circle the warehouse 10 times, but gets tired and skips 2 times, how far does he walk in one night?\", \"answer\": \"First find the total distance Carson walks along the warehouse's long sides: 600 feet/side * 2 sides = <<600*2=1200>>1200 feet\\nThen find the total distance Carson walks along the warehouse's short sides: 400 feet/side * 2 sides = <<400*2=800>>800 feet\\nAdd those two amounts to find the total distance walk in one circle: 1200 feet + 800 feet = <<1200+800=2000>>2000 feet\\nThen find the number of circles Carson actually walks: 10 circles - 2 circles = <<10-2=8>>8 circles\\nThen multiply the distance of one circle by the number of circles Carson makes: 2000 feet/circle * 8 circles = <<2000*8=16000>>16000 feet\\n#### 16000\"}\n{\"question\": \"Nate got lost looking for his car in the airport parking lot.

If Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute, how many minutes did he spend searching the parking lot?\", \"answer\": \"First find the number of cars in Section G by multiplying the number of rows by the number of cars per row: 15 rows * 10 cars/row = <<15*10=150>>150 cars\\nThen do the same thing for Section H: 20 rows * 9 cars/row = <<20*9=180>>180 cars\\nThen add the two quantities of cars to find the total number of cars Nate walked past: 150 cars + 180 cars = <<150+180=330>>330 cars\\nFinally, divide the number of cars Nate passed by the numbers he passes each minute to find how long he spent searching: 330 cars / 11 cars/minute = <<330/11=30>>30 minutes\\n#### 30\"}\n{\"question\": \"Jason is planning a parking garage that will have 12 floors.
