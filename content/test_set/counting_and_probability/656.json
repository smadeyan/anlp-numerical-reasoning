    "problem": "Two integers are relatively prime if they have no common factors other than 1 or -1. What is the probability that a positive integer less than or equal to 30 is relatively prime to 30? Express your answer as a common fraction.",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "It might be easier to find the integers less than or equal to 30 which are NOT relatively prime to 30. They include 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, $\\ldots$, 28, 30, or 15 even integers. They also include 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, or the odd multiples of 3. And also, 5, 25, the multiples of 5 relatively prime to 2 and 3. So we have a total of $15+5+2 = 22$ numbers sharing a factor with 30. So there are 8 relatively prime integers, giving us a ratio of $\\frac{8}{30} = \\boxed{\\frac{4}{15}}$.\n\nNotice that the prime divisors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5, and we have $$30\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 30 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{4}{5} = 8,$$ which equals the number of positive integers less than 30 that are relatively prime to 30.  Is this a coincidence?",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"55% of Toby's friends are boys and the rest are girls. If he has 33 friends who are boys, how many friends does he have who are girls?\", \"answer\": \"Toby has 60 friends because 33 / .55 = <<33/.55=60>>60\\n45% of his friends are girls because 100 - 55 = <<100-55=45>>45\\nHe has 27 friends who are girls because 60 x .45 = <<27=27>>27\\n#### 27\"}\n{\"question\": \"Cara has 60 marbles in a bag. 20 of them are yellow, half as many are green, and the remaining marbles are equally divided between red and blue. If Cara picks a marble at random, what are the odds it's blue (expressed as a percentage)?\", \"answer\": \"First find the number of green marbles: 20 yellow marbles / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 green marbles\\nThen find how many marbles are either red or blue: 60 marbles - 20 yellow marbles - 10 green marbles = <<60-20-10=30>>30 marbles\\nDivide this number in half to find how many marbles are blue: 30 marbles / 2 = <<30/2=15>>15 blue marbles\\nFinally, divide the number of blue marbles by the total number of marbles and multiply by 100 to find the percentage chance of getting a blue marble: 15 marbles / 60 marbles * 100 = <<15/60*100=25>>25%\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"The ages of three brothers are consecutive integers with the sum of 96.
