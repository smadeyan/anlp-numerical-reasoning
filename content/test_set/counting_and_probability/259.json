    "problem": "Suppose we flip four coins simultaneously: a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter.  What is the probability that at least 15 cents worth of coins come up heads?",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are $2^4=16$ possible outcomes, since each of the 4 coins can land 2 different ways (heads or tails). If the quarter is heads, there are 8 possibilities, since each of the other three coins may come up heads or tails.  If the quarter is tails, then the nickel and dime must be heads, so there are 2 possibilities, since the penny can be heads or tails.  So there are $8+2 = 10$ successful outcomes, and the probability of success is $\\dfrac{10}{16} = \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"If a solver flips a coin 211 times and gets a head on 65 of the flips, how many more tails than heads did he get?\", \"answer\": \"If the solver got a head in 65 of the 211 flips, he got 211-65 =<<211-65=146>>146 tails\\nThe number of tails than he got more than head is 146-65=<<146-65=81>>81\\n#### 81\"}\n{\"question\": \"Steve is holding nickels and dimes in his hand. He has 4 more dimes than nickels. He has a total of 70 cents in his hand. How many nickels is he holding?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the number of nickels he is holding.\\nHis nickels are worth 5 * x = 5x cents.\\nHe has x+4 dimes.\\nThe dimes are worth 10 * (x+4)\\nThe total worth of the nickels and dimes is 5x + 10*(x+4) = 70.\\n5x + 10x + 40 = 70\\n15x = 30\\nx = <<2=2>>2, Steve has 2 nickels in his hand.\\n#### 2\"}\n{\"question\": \"Kendall is counting her change. She has a total of $4 in quarters, dimes, and nickels. If she has 10 quarters and 12 dimes, how many nickels does she have?\", \"answer\": \"The total money from the quarters is 10 * $0.25 = $<<10*0.25=2.50>>2.50\\nThe total money from the dimes is 12 * $0.10 = $<<12*0.10=1.20>>1.20\\nThe total money from the nickels is $4 - $2.50 - $1.20 = $<<4-2.5-1.2=0.30>>0.30\\nThe number of nickels Kendall has is $0.30 / $0.05 = <<0.30/0.05=6>>6 nickels\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"Rocco stores his coins in piles of 10 coins each. He has 4 piles of quarters, 6 piles of dimes, 9 piles of nickels, and 5 piles of pennies. How much money does Rocco have?\", \"answer\": \"Each pile has 10 coins, so he has:\\n10 * 4 * $.25 = $<<10*4*.25=10.00>>10.00 worth of quarters,\\n10 * 6 * $.10 = $<<10*6*.10=6.00>>6.00 worth of dimes,\\n10 * 9 * $.05 = $<<10*9*.05=4.50>>4.50 worth of nickels, and\\n10 * 5 * $.01 = $<<10*5*.01=0.50>>0.50 worth of pennies.\\nAltogether he has $10.00 + $6.00 + $4.50 + $0.50 = $<<10+6+4.5+0.5=21.00>>21.00\\n#### 21\"}"
