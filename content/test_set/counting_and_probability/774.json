    "problem": "Two cards are chosen at random from a standard 52-card deck.  What is the probability that the first card is a heart and the second card is a 10?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are two cases.\n\nCase 1: The first card is a $\\heartsuit$ but not a 10.\n\nThe probability of the first card satisfying this is $\\dfrac{12}{52},$ and then the probability that the second card is a 10 is $\\dfrac{4}{51}.$\n\nCase 2: The first card is the 10 $\\heartsuit$.\n\nThe probability of the first card being the 10 $\\heartsuit$ is $\\dfrac{1}{52},$ and then the probability that the second card is a 10 is $\\dfrac{3}{51}.$\n\nWe then add the probability of the two cases (since they are exclusive) to get \\[\\frac{12}{52}\\times \\frac{4}{51}+\\frac{1}{52}\\times \\frac{3}{51}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{52}}.\\]",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Marcus takes a deck of standard playing cards and takes out all the face cards and the 8's. Mark picks a card at random and then replaces it 36 times. How many times should he expect to pick a card that's both red and has a number divisible by 3?\", \"answer\": \"Without the face cards and the 8's, there are 9 cards of each suit. Half these cards are red, and 3/9 have numbers divisible by 3, so the odds of drawing a card divisible by 3 are 1/3.\\nMultiply the odds of drawing a red card by the odds of drawing a card divisible by 3 to find the odds of both things happening: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6\\nFinally, multiplying the probability of drawing a red/3-divisible card by the number of cards Mark draws to find how many he should expect to meet his criteria: 1/6 * 36 cards = <<1/6*36=6>>6 cards\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"John buys 10 packs of magic cards.  Each pack has 20 cards and 1/4 of those cards are uncommon.  How many uncommon cards did he get?\", \"answer\": \"Each pack has 20/4 = <<20/4=5>>5 uncommons\\nSo he got 10*5 = <<10*5=50>>50 uncommons\\n#### 50\"}\n{\"question\": \"The number of cards in a card game was 500. Two friends Ellis and Orion, playing together, divided the cards in the ratio of 11:9. How many more cards did Ellis get than Orion?\", \"answer\": \"The total ratio representing the 500 cards is 11+9 = <<11+9=20>>20\\nThe fraction of the total ratio that represents the number of cards that Ellis got is 11/20, and since there were 500 cards, Ellis got 11/20*500 = <<11/20*500=275>>275\\nIf there were 500 cards, and Ellis received 275 cards, Orion received 500-275 = <<500-275=225>>225 cards\\nThe number of cards that Ellis received more than Orion is 275-225 = <<275-225=50>>50 cards.\\n#### 50\"}\n{\"question\": \"Kate has 2 red balloons and 4 blue balloons. Assuming she inflates 4 more balloons, two of each color red and blue, what is the percent likelihood that one selected at random will be red?\", \"answer\": \"After inflating the 4 new balloons, she will have 2 red + 4 blue + 4 new = <<2+4+4=10>>10 total balloons\\nThe probability of selecting red will be (2 red + 2 red newly inflated) / 10 total balloons = 40%\\n#### 40\"}"
