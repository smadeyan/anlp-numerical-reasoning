    "problem": "What is the largest $2$-digit prime factor of the integer $n = {200\\choose 100}$?\n",
    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "Expanding the binomial coefficient, we get ${200 \\choose 100}=\\frac{200!}{100!100!}$. Let the required prime be $p$; then $10 \\le p < 100$. If $p > 50$, then the factor of $p$ appears twice in the denominator. Thus, we need $p$ to appear as a factor at least three times in the numerator, so $3p<200$. The largest such prime is $\\boxed{61}$, which is our answer.",

The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"There are 3 consecutive odd integers that have a sum of -147.

W is tagged with the number 200, X is tagged with half the number W is tagged with, Y is tagged with the total of X and W's tags and Z is tagged with the number 400. Calculate the total of all the tagged numbers.\", \"answer\": \"If the card with the letter X has half the number the card with letter W has, it has 1/2*200= 100\\nTogether, cards with letters W and X have tags that total 100+200 = <<100+200=300>>300.\\nIf the card with the letter Y has the total of the numbers cards with letters, W and X have, then the total for cards with letters W, X, and Y is 300+300 = 600\\nSince the card with the letter Z has a tag of 200, the total of the numbers the tags have is 600+400= 1000\\n#### 1000\"}"
