    "problem": "A zealous geologist is sponsoring a contest in which entrants have to guess the age of a shiny rock. He offers these clues: the age of the rock is formed from the six digits 2, 2, 2, 3, 7, and 9, and the rock's age begins with an odd digit.\n\nHow many possibilities are there for the rock's age?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "There are 3 odd digits which can begin the rock's age. For the five remaining spaces, the numbers can be arranged in $5!$ ways.\n\nHowever, because the digit `2' repeats three times, we must divide by $3!$, or the number of ways to arrange those three 2s.\n\nThe answer is $\\dfrac{3\\times5!}{3!} = \\boxed{60}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Jim has a pail with rocks in it. The average weight of a rock is 1.5 pounds. A local rock collector agrees to pay him $4 for every pound of rocks. If he makes $60 off the sale, how many rocks were in the bucket?\", \"answer\": \"There were 15 pounds of rocks in the bucket because 60 / 4 = <<60/4=15>>15\\nThere were 10 rocks in the bucket because 15 / 1.5 = <<10=10>>10\\n#### 10\"}\n{\"question\": \"TreQuan is throwing rocks in the river and he notices that the bigger the rock, the wider the splash. Pebbles make a splash that is a 1/4 meter wide. Rocks make a splash that is 1/2 a meter wide, and boulders create a splash that is 2 meters wide. If he tosses 6 pebbles, 3 rocks, and 2 boulders, what is the total width of the splashes he makes?\", \"answer\": \"The pebble's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 6 times 1/4 equals <<6*1/4=1.5>>1.5.\\nThe rock's total splash width is 1.5 meters because 3 times 1/2 equals <<3*1/2=1.5>>1.5.\\nThe boulder's total splash width is 4 because 2 times 2 equals four.\\nThe total splash width for all the rocks is 7 because 1.5 plus 1.5 plus 4 equals 7.\\n#### 7\"}\n{\"question\": \"There are 25 different layers of rock in a canyon\\u2019s strata. Five of the layers are limestone. Half of the rest are sandstone. Four of the remaining are quartz. Half of the rest are shale. The rest are all different kinds of rock. How many kinds of rock make up only one layer in the canyon\\u2019s strata?\", \"answer\": \"There are 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20 layers of rock that are not limestone.\\nHalf of those 20 are sandstone, so there are 20 / 2 = <<20/2=10>>10 that are not limestone or sandstone.\\nFour of those are quartz, so 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 layers are not limestone, sandstone, or quartz.\\nHalf of the rest are shale, so 6 / 2 = <<6/2=3>>3 kinds of rock remain that make up only one layer in the strata.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"The total number of years in a century is the same as the number of marbles Gideon has. If he gives 3/4 of the marbles to his sister and multiples the number of remaining marbles by 2, he gets his age five years from now. How old is Gideon now?\", \"answer\": \"A century has 100 years, and if Gideon has as many marbles as the number of years in a century, he has 100 marbles.\\nIf he gives 3/4 of the marbles to his sister, he gives out 3/4*100 = <<3/4*100=75>>75 marbles.\\nGideon's total number of marbles remaining after giving 3/4 of the marbles to his sister is 100-75=<<100-75=25>>25.\\nWhen he multiplies the number of remaining marbles by 2, he gets his age five years from now, meaning he will be 25*2=<<25*2=50>>50 years old five years from now.\\nCurrently, Gideon is 50-5 = <<50-5=45>>45 years old.\\n#### 45\"}"
