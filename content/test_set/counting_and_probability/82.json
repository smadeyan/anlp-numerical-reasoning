    "solution": "We can use complementary probability to determine that the probability of its not raining tomorrow is $1 - \\frac{3}{10} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{10}}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"It is the rainy season in central Texas.  It rained for 7 hours on Monday at a rate of 1 inch per hour.  On Tuesday, it rained for 4 hours at a rate of 2 inches per hour, and on Wednesday, it rained for 2 hours at a rate of twice that of the previous day.  What is the total combined rainfall, in inches, for these three days?\", \"answer\": \"On Monday, 7 hours of rain at a rate of 1 inch per hour is 7*1=<<7*1=7>>7 inches of rain.\\nOn Tuesday, 4 hours of rain at a rate of 2 inches per hour is 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 inches of rain.\\nTwice the rate of Tuesday is 2*2=<<2*2=4>>4 inches per hour.\\nWednesday, 2 hours of rain at a rate of 4 inches per hour is 2*4=<<2*4=8>>8 inches of rain.\\nThe combined total of the rainfall for these three days is 7+8+8=<<7+8+8=23>>23 inches of rain.\\n#### 23\"}\n{\"question\": \"In a single day, it rained for many hours. From 2pm to 4pm, it rained at a rate of 4 inches per hour.  From 4pm to 7pm, it rained at a rate of 3 inches per hour.  And from 7pm to 9pm, it rained at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour.  If the rain gauge started out the day already containing 2 inches of rainwater, how many inches of water will the gauge contain at 9pm?\", \"answer\": \"From 2pm to 4pm is 4-2=2 hours.\\nThus, from 2-4pm, raining at 4 inches per hour, it added 8 inches to the rain gauge.\\nFrom 4pm to 7pm is 7-4=<<7-4=3>>3 hours.\\nThus, from 4-7pm, raining at a rate of 3 inches per hour, it added 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 inches to the rain gauge.\\nFrom 7pm to 9pm is 9-7=<<9-7=2>>2 hours.\\nThus, from 7-9pm, raining at a rate of 0.5 inches per hour, it added 2*0.5=1 inch to the gauge.\\nIf the gauge originally contained 2 inches of water, by 9pm the gauge contained 2+8+9+1=<<2+8+9+1=20>>20 inches of water.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"It rained twice as much on Tuesday as Monday.  On Monday it rained 3 inches more than Sunday.  It rained 4 inches on Sunday.  How much total rainfall was there over the 3 days?\", \"answer\": \"It rained 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches on Monday\\nSo it rained 7*2=<<7*2=14>>14 inches on Tuesday\\nThat means the total rainfall was 7+14+4=<<7+14+4=25>>25 inches\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"It starts raining at 7:00 and pours heavily until its stops at 17:00  on a particular day. On the second day, the rain takes 2 more hours than it took on the first day to stop. On the third day, the rain pours for twice the amount of time it took on the second day. Calculate the total time it was raining in the three days.\", \"answer\": \"On the first day, it rained for 17:00 - 7:00 = 10 hours\\nOn the second day, it 10 hours + 2 hours = <<10+2=12>>12 hours for the rain to stop\\nIt rained for 2 * 12 hours = <<2*12=24>>24 hours on the third day.\\nIn the three days, it was raining for 24 hours + 12 hours + 10 hours = <<24+12+10=46>>46 hours.\\n#### 46\"}"
