    "problem": "My soccer team has 16 players.  I have to choose a starting lineup of a goalie and 10 regular players (the regular players are interchangeable).  How many different starting lineups can I choose?",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "First we choose the goalie, and any of the 16 people can be the goalie. Then we choose 10 more players from the remaining 15 players, which is the same as choosing a committee. The answer is \\[16\\binom{15}{10}=16\\binom{15}{5}=16\\times\\frac{15\\times 14\\times 13\\times 12\\times 11}{5\\times 4\\times 3\\times 2\\times 1}=\\boxed{48,\\!048}.\\]",

If the team has 40 players, how many strikers are in the team?\", \"answer\": \"The team's total number of goalies and defenders is 3+10 = <<3+10=13>>13.\\nThe number of midfielders in the team is twice the number of defenders, which means there are 2*10=<<2*10=20>>20 defenders in the team.\\nThe total number of players in the team playing the positions of goalies, defenders and midfielders is 20+13 = <<20+13=33>>33\\nIf there are 40 players in the team, then the number of strikes in the team is 40-33 = <<40-33=7>>7\\n#### 7\"}\n{\"question\": \"A soccer team had 24 players prepared for a soccer game. The first half saw 11 players start the game with 2 substitutions made. In the second half, the team made twice as many substitutions as it made in the first half.

They have scored 150 goals on the season. There have been 15 games played. 1/3 of the players have averaged 1 goal each per game. How many total goals have the other players scored?\", \"answer\": \"8 players have averaged 1 goal a game because 24 x (1/3) = <<24*(1/3)=8>>8\\nThese players average a total of 8 goals a game because 8 x 1 = <<8*1=8>>8\\nThese players have scored 120 goals because 8 x 15 = <<8*15=120>>120\\nThe remaining players have scored 30 total goals because 150 - 120 = <<150-120=30>>30\\n#### 30\"}\n{\"question\": \"Mike wants to be the best goalkeeper on his soccer team.
