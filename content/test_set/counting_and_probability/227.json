    "problem": "Consider a regular octagon.  How many triangles can be formed whose vertices are the vertices of the octagon?",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Counting & Probability",
    "solution": "No three vertices are collinear, so any combination of 3 vertices will make a triangle. There are 8 ways to choose the first point, 7 ways to choose the second point, and 6 ways to choose the third point, but we must divide by $3!$ since order doesn't matter.  So the answer is $\\dfrac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3!} = \\boxed{56}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"How many right triangles with a height of 2 inches and a width of two inches could fit inside a square with 2-inch sides?\", \"answer\": \"A triangle with a height of 2 inches and width of 2 inches has an area of 2 square inches because (1/2) x 2 x 2 = <<(1/2)*2*2=2>>2\\nThe square has an area of 4 square inches because 2 x 2 = <<2*2=4>>4\\n2 triangles would fit because 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2\\n#### 2\"}\n{\"question\": \"The three angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees.  The largest angle is 5 times bigger than the smallest. The middle angle is 3 times bigger than the smallest. How many degrees is the smallest angle?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the smallest angle.\\nThe combination of the three is x + 3x + 5x = 9x.\\nThus 9x = 180.\\nSo x = <<20=20>>20.\\n#### 20\"}\n{\"question\": \"The area of a triangle with a given base and height is given by 1/2*base*height. What is the base length of a triangle with height 8 and area 24 square units?\", \"answer\": \"Let b be the base of the triangle\\n(1/2)*b*8=24.\\n4*b=24\\nb=<<6=6>>6\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\", \"answer\": \"Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared.\\nThe square of the base of the first triangle is 4*4=<<4*4=16>>16 square inches\\nThe square of the height of the first triangle is 3*3=<<3*3=9>>9 square inches.\\nThe sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16+9=<<16+9=25>>25\\nThe square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is \\u221a25=5 inches.\\nSince the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3+4=<<3+4=7>>7 inches\\nIf you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7+5=<<7+5=12>>12 inches.\\n#### 12\"}"
