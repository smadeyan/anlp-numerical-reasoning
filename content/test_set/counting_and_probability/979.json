How many rounds did William win?\", \"answer\": \"They played 15 rounds and William won 5 more rounds than Harry so that leaves 15 - 5 = <<15-5=10>>10 round\\nThere are 2 players and 10 rounds so they each won 10/2 = 5 rounds\\nWilliam won 5 more rounds than Harry and they each won 5 rounds so William won 5+5 = <<5+5=10>>10 rounds\\n#### 10\"}\n{\"question\": \"Taro and Vlad play a video game competition together, earning 5 points for every win. After playing 30 rounds, Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points scored. How many total points did Vlad score?\", \"answer\": \"If they played 30 rounds, the total possible points from wins are 5*30 = <<5*30=150>>150 points.\\nScoring 3/5 of the total possible points earns you 3/5 * 150 points = <<3/5*150=90>>90 points\\nIf Taro scored 4 points less than 3/5 of the total points, he scored 90 points - 4 points = <<90-4=86>>86 points.\\nIf the total points scored in the game is 150, then Vlad scored 150 points - 86 points = <<150-86=64>>64 points\\n#### 64\"}\n{\"question\": \"David and Brenda are playing Scrabble.
