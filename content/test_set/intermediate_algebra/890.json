    "problem": "Find the number of functions $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that\n\\[f(x + f(y)) = x + y\\]for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$",
    "level": "Level 3",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Setting $x = -f(y),$ we get\n\\[f(0) = -f(y) + y,\\]so $f(y) = y - f(0)$ for all real numbers $x.$  Then the given functional equation becomes\n\\[f(x + y - f(0)) = x + y,\\]or $x + y - f(0) - f(0) = x + y.$  Then $f(0) = 0,$ so $f(x) = x$ for all real numbers $x.$  This function does satisfy the given functional equation, giving us $\\boxed{1}$ solution.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Stacy is a high school Calculus teacher.  She assigns 45 problems for homework.  There are twice as many multiple choice problems as free response, and 7 more free response than true/false.  How many true/false questions are there?\", \"answer\": \"Let x represent the number of true/false questions\\nFree response:x+7\\nMultiple choice: 2(x+7)=2x+14\\nTotal:x+x+7+2x+14=45\\n4x+21=45\\n4x=24\\nx=<<6=6>>6 true/false questions\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"A jar full of marbles is sitting on a table. Half of the marbles are blue, a quarter of them are red, 27 of them are green, and 14 of them are yellow. How many marbles are in the jar?\", \"answer\": \"Let x = the number of marbles in the jar.\\nIf 50% of the marbles are blue, and 25% of them are red, then the remaining 25% must be either green or yellow.\\nSo 0.25 * x = 27 green marbles + 14 yellow marbles = 41 marbles.\\nSo there are a total of 4 * 41 = <<4*41=164>>164 marbles in the jar.\\n#### 164\"}"
