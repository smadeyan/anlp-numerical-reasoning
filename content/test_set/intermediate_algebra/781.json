What is the area of the rectangle?\", \"answer\": \"The length of the rectangle is 4 * 7 inches = <<4*7=28>>28 inches.\\nThe area of the rectangle is 7 inches * 28 inches = <<7*28=196>>196 square inches.\\n#### 196\"}\n{\"question\": \"Bailey is making a rectangle out of a 100cm length of rope he has. If the longer sides of the rectangle were 28cm long, what is the length of each of the shorter sides?\", \"answer\": \"The longer sides are 2 in number so their total length of 2*28cm = <<2*28=56>>56cm\\nThe rest of the length making up the short sides is 100-56 = <<100-56=44>>44 cm\\nThere are two equal short sides so each one is 44/2 = <<44/2=22>>22cm\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"The perimeter of a square-shaped piece of paper is 20 cm shorter than the height of a computer screen. How many cm is the height of the screen if the side of the square paper is 20 cm?\", \"answer\": \"The perimeter of a square is found by 4*side, which means the square paper has a perimeter of 4*20 = <<4*20=80>>80\\nSince the perimeter of the square is 20 cm shorter than the height of the computer screen, the height of the computer screen is 20+80 = <<20+80=100>>100cm.\\n#### 100\"}\n{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}"
