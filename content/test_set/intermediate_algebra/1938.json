    "problem": "Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers so that the roots of\n\\[z^2 + (10 + ai) z + (27 + bi) = 0\\]are complex conjugates.  Enter the ordered pair $(a,b).$",
    "level": "Level 4",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Let $z = x + yi,$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.  Then both\n\\[z + \\overline{z} = (x + yi) + (x - yi) = 2x,\\]and\n\\[z \\overline{z} = (x + yi)(x - yi) = x^2 + y^2\\]are real numbers.  Therefore, by Vieta's formulas, all the coefficients must be real numbers.  Then $(a,b) = \\boxed{(0,0)}.$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"If you double a number and add 5 to the result, then that's 20 more than half of the original number. What's the original number?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the original number.\\n2*x+5=20+x/2\\n2*x-x/2=15\\n4*x-x=30\\n3*x=30\\nx=<<10=10>>10\\n#### 4\"}\n{\"question\": \"Milton has some books about zoology and 4 times as many books about botany. If he has 80 books total, how many zoology books does he have?\", \"answer\": \"Let z be the number of zoology books and b be the number of botany books. We know that z + b = 80 and b = 4z.\\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get z + 4z = 80\\nCombining like terms, we get 5z = 80\\nDividing both sides by 5, we get z = 16\\n#### 16\"}\n{\"question\": \"Bill and Joan both work for a library. 5 years ago, Joan had 3 times as much experience as Bill. Now she has twice as much experience as Bill. How many years of experience does Bill have now?\", \"answer\": \"Let b be Bill's years of experience and j be Joan's years of experience. We know that j - 5 = 3(b - 5) and j = 2b.\\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 2b - 5 = 3(b - 5)\\nMultiplying through the parentheses, we get 2b - 5 = 3b - 15\\nAdding 15 to both sides, we get 2b + 10 = 3b\\nSubtracting 2b from both sides, we get 10 = b\\n#### 10\"}\n{\"question\": \"Leonard is 4 years younger than Nina who is half as old as Jerome. If the sum of their ages is 36, what is Leonard's age?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the age of Nina.\\nSo, Leonard's age is x - 4.\\nAnd Jerome's age is 2x.\\nSince the sum of their ages is 36, then the equation is x + x - 4 + 2x = 36.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 4x = 40.\\nSo the value of x which represents the age of Nina is x = 40/4 = <<40/4=10>>10.\\nTherefore, Leonard is 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 years old.\\n#### 6\"}"
