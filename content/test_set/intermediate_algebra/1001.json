    "level": "Level 5",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We complete the square with respect to the terms $b^2$ and $\\frac{b}{a},$ to get\n\\[b^2 + \\frac{b}{a} = \\left( b + \\frac{1}{2a} \\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{4a^2}.\\]This is minimized when $b = -\\frac{1}{2a}.$  The problem now is to minimize\n\\[a^2 + \\frac{1}{a^2} - \\frac{1}{4a^2} = a^2 + \\frac{3}{4a^2}.\\]We can assume that $a$ is positive.  Then by AM-GM,\n\\[a^2 + \\frac{3}{4a^2} \\ge 2 \\sqrt{a^2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4a^2}} = \\sqrt{3}.\\]Equality occurs when $a = \\sqrt[4]{\\frac{3}{4}},$ so the minimum value is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}.$",

If a pencil costs $2, find the total cost of both items.\", \"answer\": \"A pen costs $9 more than $2 which is $9+$2 = $<<9+2=11>>11\\nAltogether they cost $11+$2 = $<<11+2=13>>13\\n#### 13\"}\n{\"question\": \"Emily went to the store and bought art supplies for $20 and 2 skirts that cost the same amount of money. She spent a total of $50. How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\", \"answer\": \"First, you need to set up the problem with the information given. The cost of the skirts and art supplies must equal $<<50=50>>50.\\nSince we know that the cost of the skirts is the same price and that she bought art supplies for $20, we can set up an equation: 2x + 20 = 50, with x being the cost of the skirts.\\nTo solve the equation, subtract 20 from both sides, to give you the new equation: 2x = 30.\\nSolve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, 2x/2 = 30/2 gives you x = 15.\\nTherefore, each skirt cost $<<15=15>>15.\\n#### 15\"}\n{\"question\": \"Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?\", \"answer\": \"Let her previous monthly income be p\\nThe cost of her rent and utilities was 40% of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5\\nHer income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600\\nThe cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4\\nEquating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4\\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000\\nSubtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000\\nDividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000\\n#### 1000\"}"
