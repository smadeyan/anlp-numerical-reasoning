    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "Calculate the magnitudes. $$|t+2i\\sqrt{3}| |6-4i| = \\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot \\sqrt{36+16} = \\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot \\sqrt{52} = \\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{13}$$Set this equal to $26$. $$\\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{13} = 26$$Solve for $t$. $$\\sqrt{t^2+12} \\cdot \\sqrt{13} = 13$$$$\\sqrt{t^2+12} = \\sqrt{13}$$We need the positive value, so $t = \\boxed{1}$.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Mrs. Snyder used to spend 40% of her monthly income on rent and utilities. Her salary was recently increased by $600 so now her rent and utilities only amount to 25% of her monthly income. How much was her previous monthly income?\", \"answer\": \"Let her previous monthly income be p\\nThe cost of her rent and utilities was 40% of p which is (40/100)*p = 2p/5\\nHer income was increased by $600 so it is now p+$600\\nThe cost of her rent and utilities now amount to 25% of (p+$600) which is (25/100)*(p+$600) = (p+$600)/4\\nEquating both expressions for cost of rent and utilities: 2p/5 = (p+$600)/4\\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 20 gives 8p = 5p+$3000\\nSubtracting 5p from both sides gives: 3p = $3000\\nDividing both sides by 3 gives p = $1000\\n#### 1000\"}\n{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"Leonard is 4 years younger than Nina who is half as old as Jerome. If the sum of their ages is 36, what is Leonard's age?\", \"answer\": \"Let x be the age of Nina.\\nSo, Leonard's age is x - 4.\\nAnd Jerome's age is 2x.\\nSince the sum of their ages is 36, then the equation is x + x - 4 + 2x = 36.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 4x = 40.\\nSo the value of x which represents the age of Nina is x = 40/4 = <<40/4=10>>10.\\nTherefore, Leonard is 10 - 4 = <<10-4=6>>6 years old.\\n#### 6\"}\n{\"question\": \"John starts climbing a very steep hill.  He travels 1 foot vertically for every two feet horizontally.  His elevation increases from 100 feet to 1450 feet.  How far does he move horizontally, in feet?\", \"answer\": \"He travels 1450-100=<<1450-100=1350>>1350 feet vertically\\nSo he travels 1350*2=<<1350*2=2700>>2700 feet horizontally\\n#### 2700\"}"
