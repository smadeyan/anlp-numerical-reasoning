    "level": "Level 2",
    "type": "Intermediate Algebra",
    "solution": "We can use the coefficient of the $x^3$ term to find $b$. On the right we have $-14x^3$, and on the left, the only $x^3$ terms we will get when we expand are $-3x(ax^2)$ and $5x^2(bx)$.\n\nSo we must have\n$$-3ax^3 + 5bx^3 = -14x^3$$which means\n$$5b - 3a = -14$$To find $a$, we use the same reasoning and look at the $x^4$ terms. On the right we have $15x^4$, and on the left, the only $x^4$ term we will get when we expand is $5x^2(ax^2)$. Then we know that\n$$5ax^4 = 15x^4$$which means that $a=3$.\n\nThen $5b -3(3) = -14$ and $b = \\boxed{-1}$.",

She spent a total of $50. How much did Emily pay for each of the skirts?\", \"answer\": \"First, you need to set up the problem with the information given. The cost of the skirts and art supplies must equal $<<50=50>>50.\\nSince we know that the cost of the skirts is the same price and that she bought art supplies for $20, we can set up an equation: 2x + 20 = 50, with x being the cost of the skirts.\\nTo solve the equation, subtract 20 from both sides, to give you the new equation: 2x = 30.\\nSolve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, 2x/2 = 30/2 gives you x = 15.\\nTherefore, each skirt cost $<<15=15>>15.\\n#### 15\"}\n{\"question\": \"Together, Alan and Marcy handed out 150 parking tickets. If Marcy handed out 6 fewer than 5 times as many tickets as Alan, how many tickets did Alan hand out?\", \"answer\": \"Let a be the number of tickets Alan hands out and m be the number Marcy hands out. We know that a + m = 150 and m = 5a - 6\\nSubstituting the second equation into the first, we get a + 5a - 6 = 150\\nAdding 2 to both sides, we get a + 5a = 156\\nCombining like terms, we get 6a = 156\\nDividing both sides by 6, we get a = 26\\n#### 26\"}\n{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}"
