    "solution": "We consider cases. Either the exponent is $0$, or the base must be either $1$ or $-1$. (These are the only ways that $a^b=1$ is possible if $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.  Also, if the base is $-1$, then the exponent must be an even integer.)\n\nNote: The first two cases use Vieta's Formula for the sum of the roots of a quadratic. A short derivation follows in case you are not familiar with them.\n\nVieta's Formulas\n\nIf $p$ and $q$ are roots of the quadratic $x^2 + bx + c$ then $(x-p)(x-q)=0$. But $(x-p)(x-q) = x^2 - (p+q)x +(pq)$. Therefore, the sum of roots, $p+q$, equals $-b$ and the product of roots, $pq$, equals $c$.\n\nIf you have a quadratic where the leading coefficient is not $1$ (and not $0$), then it can be written in the form $ax^2 + bx + c$. Since to find the roots we set it equal to $0$, we can divide the entire thing by $a$ to get $x^2 + \\frac ba x + \\frac ca = 0$. Similar to the case where the leading coefficient is $1$, the sum of roots, $p+q$ will now be $- \\frac ba$ and the product of roots, $pq$, will now be $\\frac ca$.\n\nCases\n\nFirst case: The exponent is $0$ when $0=x^2-5x+2$. Note that the discriminant of this quadratic equation is $5^2-4(1)(2)=17$, which is positive; thus there are two distinct real roots. By Vieta's formulas, they add up to $5$. Furthermore, note that neither of these roots is also a root of $x^2-4x+2=0$, so we don't have to worry about getting $0^0$ in our original equation. Thus we have our first two solutions, and they add up to $5$.\n\nSecond case: The base is $1$ when $0=x^2-4x+1$. Again, this equation has a positive discriminant and thus two real roots. By Vieta's formulas, these roots add up to $4$. Both are automatically solutions to our original equation, since $1^b=1$ for all real $b$.\n\nThird case: The base is $-1$ when $0=x^2-4x+3=(x-1)(x-3)$ (finally, a quadratic we can factor nicely!). This gives us potential solutions of $x=1$ and $x=3$, but we'd better check them! As it turns out $x=1$ gives $(-1)^{-2}=1$ and $x=3$ gives $(-1)^{-4}=1$, so both are solutions to our original equation.\n\nThus we have six solutions in all. The first two added up to $5$, the next two added up to $4$, and the last two added up to $4$, so the sum of the six solutions is $\\boxed{13}$.",

If the first number is 200, and the value of the second number is twice the value of the third number, find the value of the third number.\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the third number is x.\\nThe sum of the second and third number is 500-200 = <<500-200=300>>300\\nSince the third number is x, the sum of the values of the second and third number is x+2x = 300\\nThis is 3x=300\\nThe value of the third number is x=300/3\\nx=<<100=100>>100\\n#### 100\"}\n{\"question\": \"Ali, Nada, and John have a total of $67 in their wallets. Ali has $5 less than Nada and John has 4 times more than Nada. How much money does John have?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say that N is what Nada has, J is what John has, and A is what Ali has. We know that A = N - 5 and J = 4N.\\nWe also know that: N + A + J = $67\\nWe can substitute the equations from step 1 into the equations from step 2 to get: N + 4N + (N-5) = $67\\nCombining like terms gets us 6N - 5 = $67\\nSo, N=($67+5)/6 = $12\\nSubstituting $12 back into the equation J = 4 N, we find John has 4 x 12 = $<<4*12=48>>48\\n#### 48\"}\n{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}"
