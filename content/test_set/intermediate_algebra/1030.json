    "solution": "First, we decompose $\\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n}$ into partial fractions.  We factor the denominator:\n\\begin{align*}\nn^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n &= n(n^5 - n^4 + n^3 - n^2 + n - 1) \\\\\n&= n(n^4 (n - 1) + n^2 (n - 1) + (n - 1)) \\\\\n&= n(n - 1)(n^4 + n^2 + 1) \\\\\n&= n(n - 1)[(n^4 + 2n^2 + 1) - n^2] \\\\\n&= n(n - 1)[(n^2 + 1)^2 - n^2] \\\\\n&= n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1).\n\\end{align*}Then by partial fractions,\n\\[\\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1)} = \\frac{A}{n} + \\frac{B}{n - 1} + \\frac{Cn + D}{n^2 + n + 1} + \\frac{En + F}{n^2 - n + 1}\\]for some constants $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F.$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1),$ we get\n\\begin{align*}\n4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1 &= A(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\\\\n&\\quad + Bn(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\\\\n&\\quad + (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\\\\n&\\quad + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).\n\\end{align*}Setting $n = 0,$ we get $-A = 1,$ so $A = -1.$\n\nSetting $n = 1,$ we get $3B = 3,$ so $B = 1.$  The equation above then becomes\n\\begin{align*}\n4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1 &= -(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\\\\n&\\quad + n(n^2 + n + 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\\\\n&\\quad + (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) \\\\\n&\\quad + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).\n\\end{align*}This simplifies to\n\\[n^4 + 4n^3 - 2n^2 - n = (Cn + D)n(n - 1)(n^2 - n + 1) + (En + F)n(n - 1)(n^2 + n + 1).\\]Dividing both sides by $n(n - 1),$ we get\n\\[-n^2 + 3n + 1 = (Cn + D)(n^2 - n + 1) + (En + F)(n^2 + n + 1).\\]Expanding, we get\n\\[-n^2 + 3n + 1 = (C + E)n^3 + (C + D + E + F)n^2 + (C - D + E + F)n + D + F.\\]Matching coefficients, we get\n\\begin{align*}\nC + E &= 0, \\\\\n-C + D + E + F &= -1, \\\\\nC - D + E + F &= 3, \\\\\nD + F &= 1.\n\\end{align*}Since $C + E = 0,$ $-D + F = 3.$  Hence, $D = -1$ and $F = 2.$  Then $-C + E = -2,$ so $C = 1$ and $E = -1.$  Therefore,\n\\[\\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n} = \\frac{1}{n - 1} - \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{n - 1}{n^2 + n + 1} - \\frac{n - 2}{n^2 - n + 1}.\\]Then\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{4n^3 - n^2 - n + 1}{n^6 - n^5 + n^4 - n^3 + n^2 - n} &= \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{7} \\right) \\\\\n&\\quad + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{13} - \\frac{1}{7} \\right) \\\\\n&\\quad + \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{21} - \\frac{2}{13} \\right) + \\dotsb \\\\\n&= \\boxed{1}.\n\\end{align*}",
