    "solution": "Our strategy is to take $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ and divide into several expression, apply AM-GM to each expression, and come up with a multiple of $2ab \\sqrt{2} + 2bc.$\n\nSince we want terms of $ab$ and $bc$ after applying AM-GM, we divide $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ into\n\\[(a^2 + kb^2) + [(1 - k)b^2 + c^2].\\]By AM-GM,\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + kb^2 &\\ge 2 \\sqrt{(a^2)(kb^2)} = 2ab \\sqrt{k}, \\\\\n(1 - k)b^2 + c^2 &\\ge 2 \\sqrt{((1 - k)b^2)(c^2)} = 2bc \\sqrt{1 - k}.\n\\end{align*}To get a multiple of $2ab \\sqrt{2} + 2bc,$ we want $k$ so that\n\\[\\frac{2 \\sqrt{k}}{2 \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{1 - k}}{2}.\\]Then\n\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{1 - k}.\\]Squaring both sides, we get\n\\[\\frac{k}{2} = 1 - k.\\]Solving for $k,$ we find $k = \\frac{2}{3}.$\n\nThus,\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 + \\frac{2}{3} b^2 &\\ge 2ab \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}, \\\\\n\\frac{1}{3} b^2 + c^2 &\\ge 2bc \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}},\n\\end{align*}so\n\\[1 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\ge 2ab \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}} + 2bc \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}}.\\]Multiplying by $\\sqrt{3},$ we get\n\\[2ab \\sqrt{3} + 2bc \\le \\sqrt{3}.\\]Equality occurs when $a = b \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$ and $b \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = c.$  Using the condition $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1,$ we can solve to get $a = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{6}},$ $b = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{6}},$ and $c = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{6}}.$  Therefore, the maximum value is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}.$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"Karen's class fund contains only $10 and $20 bills,  which amount to $120. The number of $10 bills is twice as many $20 bills. How many $20 bills do they have in their fund?\", \"answer\": \"If n is the number of $20 bills then 2n is the number of $10 bills.\\nSo the equation will be $10(2n) + $20n = $120.\\nBy combining like terms, the equation becomes 40n = 120.\\nSo, the value of n which represents the number of $20 bills is 120/40 = <<120/40=3>>3.\\n#### 3\"}\n{\"question\": \"The sum of the three sides of a triangle is 50. The right side of the triangle is 2 cm longer than the left side. Find the value of the triangle base if the left side has a value of 12 cm.\", \"answer\": \"If the left side of the triangle is 12, and the right side is 2 cm longer, the right side is 12+2 = <<12+2=14>>14 cm long.\\nThe sum of the left and right sides of the triangle is 14+12 = <<14+12=26>>26 cm.\\nIf the sum of all sides of the is 50, and the left and right sides of the triangle are 26, the triangle base is 50-26 = <<50-26=24>>24 cm.\\n#### 24\"}\n{\"question\": \"There are 3 numbers that are consecutive integers. Together they have a sum of 18. What is the largest of the 3 numbers?\", \"answer\": \"Let N = smallest number\\nN + 1 = next number\\nN + 2 = largest number\\nN + (N + 1) + (N + 2) = 18\\n3N + 3 = 18\\n3N = <<3*5=15>>15\\nN = <<5=5>>5\\nThe largest number is <<7=7>>7.\\n#### 7\"}\n{\"question\": \"Ali, Nada, and John have a total of $67 in their wallets. Ali has $5 less than Nada and John has 4 times more than Nada. How much money does John have?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say that N is what Nada has, J is what John has, and A is what Ali has. We know that A = N - 5 and J = 4N.\\nWe also know that: N + A + J = $67\\nWe can substitute the equations from step 1 into the equations from step 2 to get: N + 4N + (N-5) = $67\\nCombining like terms gets us 6N - 5 = $67\\nSo, N=($67+5)/6 = $12\\nSubstituting $12 back into the equation J = 4 N, we find John has 4 x 12 = $<<4*12=48>>48\\n#### 48\"}"
