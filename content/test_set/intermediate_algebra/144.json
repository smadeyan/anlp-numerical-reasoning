    "solution": "By Cauchy-Schwarz\n\\[\\left( \\frac{49}{4} + 4 + 4 \\right) (4x^2 + y^2 + 16z^2) \\ge (7x + 2y + 8z)^2.\\]Since $4x^2 + y^2 + 16z^2 = 1,$\n\\[(7x + 2y + 8z)^2 \\le \\frac{81}{4}.\\]Hence, $7x + 2y + 8z \\le \\frac{9}{2}.$\n\nFor equality to occur, we must have $\\frac{2x}{7/2} = \\frac{y}{2} = \\frac{4z}{2}$ and $4x^2 + y^2 + 16z^2 = 1.$  We can solve, to find $x = \\frac{7}{18},$ $y = \\frac{4}{9},$ and $z = \\frac{1}{9},$ so the maximum value of $7x + 2y + 8z$ is $\\boxed{\\frac{9}{2}}.$",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"A rectangular flowerbed in the city park is 4 meters wide. Its length is 1 meter less than twice its width. The government wants to fence the flowerbed. How many meters of fence are needed?\", \"answer\": \"Twice the width is 4 x 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 meters.\\nThe length of the rectangular flowerbed is 8 - 1= <<8-1=7>>7 meters.\\nSince the rectangular flower bed has 2 equal lengths, then it needs 7 x 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 meters of fence.\\nThe rectangular bed has also 2 equal widths, so it needs 4 x 2 = <<8=8>>8 meters of fence.\\nTherefore, the rectangular flower bed needs a total of 14 + 8 = <<14+8=22>>22 meters of fence.\\n#### 22\"}\n{\"question\": \"Carlson bought land that cost $8000 and additional land that cost $4000. He initially owned 300 square meters of land. If the land he bought costs $20 per square meter, how big is his land after buying the new land?\", \"answer\": \"Carlson bought land that cost $20 per square meter, therefore the size of the land he bought is 8000/20 = 400.\\nAnd the size of the other land he bought is 4000/20 = <<4000/20=200>>200.\\nTherefore the total size of the land he owns is 400+200+300 = <<400+200+300=900>>900.\\n#### 900\"}\n{\"question\": \"The area of a forest is three times the area of the square-shaped street. If the street has a length of 100 meters on one side and the number of trees per square meter in the forest is 4, calculate the total number of trees in the forest.\", \"answer\": \"Since the area of a square is sides squared, the area of the square-shaped street is 100*100 = <<100*100=10000>>10000 square meters.\\nThe area of the forest is three times the area of the square-shaped street, a total of 3*10000 = <<3*10000=30000>>30000 square meters.\\nIf the number of trees per square meter in the forest is 4, there are 4*30000 = <<4*30000=120000>>120000 trees in the forest.\\n#### 120000\"}\n{\"question\": \"An apartment complex has 4 identical buildings.  Each building has 10 studio apartments, 20 2 person apartments, and 5 4 person apartments.  How many people live in the apartment complex if it has 75% of its maximum occupancy?\", \"answer\": \"First, we find out how many people live in each building. In addition to 10 1 person apartments, as a studio apartment is for a single person, there are 20 2 person apartments meaning there are 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 people capable of living there.\\nWe then find out how many people can live in the 4 person apartments by multiplying the number of available 4 person apartments by 4, performing 5*4=20 people capable of living there.\\nSo, in 1 building there is room for 10+40+20=<<10+40+20=70>>70 people.\\nWe multiply this by the 4 buildings in total, finding a maximum occupancy of 4*70=<<4*70=280>>280 people\\nWe then multiply this by .75 to find out how many people would live there at 75% of maximum occupancy, performing 280*.75= <<210=210>>210 people.\\n#### 210\"}"
