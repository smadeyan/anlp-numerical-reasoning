    "solution": "Suppose $f(z)=z^2+iz+1=c=a+bi$. We look for $z$ with $\\text{Im}(z)>0$ such that $a,b$ are integers where $|a|, |b|\\leq 10$.\n\nFirst, use the quadratic formula:\n\n$ z = \\frac{1}{2} (-i \\pm \\sqrt{-1-4(1-c)}) = -\\frac{i}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{ -\\frac{5}{4} + c }$\n\nGenerally, consider the imaginary part of a radical of a complex number: $\\sqrt{u}$, where $u = v+wi = r e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n$\\Im (\\sqrt{u}) = \\Im(\\pm \\sqrt{r} e^{i\\theta/2}) = \\pm \\sqrt{r} \\sin(i\\theta/2) = \\pm \\sqrt{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos\\theta}{2}} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{r-v}{2}}$.\n\nNow let $u= -5/4 + c$, then $v = -5/4 + a$, $w=b$, $r=\\sqrt{v^2 + w^2}$.\n\nNote that $\\Im(z)>0$ if and only if $\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{r-v}{2}}>\\frac{1}{2}$. The latter is true only when we take the positive sign, and that $r-v > 1/2$,\n\nor $v^2 + w^2 > (1/2 + v)^2 = 1/4 + v + v^2$, $w^2 > 1/4 + v$, or $b^2 > a-1$.\n\nIn other words, for all $z$, $f(z)=a+bi$ satisfies $b^2 > a-1$, and there is one and only one $z$ that makes it true. Therefore we are just going to count the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that $a$, $b$ are integers of magnitude no greater than $10$, and that $b^2 \\geq a$.\n\nWhen $a\\leq 0$, there is no restriction on $b$ so there are $11\\cdot 21 = 231$ pairs;\n\nwhen $a > 0$, there are $2(1+4+9+10+10+10+10+10+10+10)=2(84)=168$ pairs.\n\nThus there are $231+168=\\boxed{399}$ numbers in total.",
    "prompt": "{\"question\": \"While practising for his upcoming math exams, Hayes realised that the area of a circle he had just solved was equal to the perimeter of a square he had solved in the previous problem. If the area of the circle was 100, what's the length of one side of the square?\", \"answer\": \"Let's say the side of a square is s.To get the perimeter of a square, you add all the sides, which is s+s+s+s = 100\\nTherefore, 4s=<<100=100>>100\\nTherefore one side of the square is s =100/4 = <<100/4=25>>25\\n#### 25\"}\n{\"question\": \"Milton has some books about zoology and 4 times as many books about botany. If he has 80 books total, how many zoology books does he have?\", \"answer\": \"Let z be the number of zoology books and b be the number of botany books. We know that z + b = 80 and b = 4z.\\nSubstituting the second equation into the first equation, we get z + 4z = 80\\nCombining like terms, we get 5z = 80\\nDividing both sides by 5, we get z = 16\\n#### 16\"}\n{\"question\": \"Stacy is a high school Calculus teacher.
